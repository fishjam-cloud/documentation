# Streaming media

### Initialize access to your devices

Fishjam provides an API to browse and manage media devices you can use.  
To ask the browser for permission to list the available devices, call the `initializeDevices` function.

```ts
import { useInitializeDevices } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

function useExample() {
  const { initializeDevices } = useInitializeDevices();

  useEffect(() => {
    initializeDevices();
  }, [initializeDevices]);
}
```

:::info
The code above will make the browser ask the user for camera and microphone permissions.  
:::

### Device API

To manage users' camera and microphone devices, use the respective `useCamera` and `useMicrophone` hooks.  
Both of them has the same API. To keep things simple, let's just use the camera hook.

```tsx
import { useCamera } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

function ExampleComponent() {
  const camera = useCamera();

  return (
    <div>
      {camera.isStreaming && <p>You are going live!</p>}

      <p>Active device: {camera.activeDevice?.label ?? "None"}</p>

      <select onChange={(e) => camera.initialize(e.target.value)}>
        {camera.devices.map(({ label, deviceId }) => (
          <option key={deviceId} value={deviceId}>
            {label}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>

      {camera.stream && <VideoPlayer stream={camera.stream} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```
