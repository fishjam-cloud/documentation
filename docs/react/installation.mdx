# Installation

## 1. Install the package

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @fishjam-cloud/react-client
```

## 2. Setup Fishjam context

Wrap your app in our `FishjamProvider` component.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { FishjamProvider } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    // highlight-next-line
    <FishjamProvider>
      <App />
      // highlight-next-line
    </FishjamProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

:::tip

It's possible to have many independent Fishjam contexts in one app.  
Just render many `FishjamProvider` components and make sure they don't overlap.
