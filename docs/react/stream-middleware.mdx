# Stream middleware

Stream middleware in Fishjam allows you to intercept and manipulate media tracks before they are sent to the Fishjam server.
This feature is powerful for applying effects, custom encodings, or any other transformations to the media stream.

## Overview

Define a `TrackMiddleware` function which takes a `MediaStreamTrack` and returns an object containing the modified `MediaStreamTrack`
and an optional `onClear` function, which is called when the middleware needs to be removed or reapplied when a device changes.

### Type definition

```typescript
export type TrackMiddleware = (
  track: MediaStreamTrack
) => { track: MediaStreamTrack; onClear?: () => void } | null;
```

### Setting middleware

You can set the middleware for your media tracks using `setTrackMiddleware` method. This method accepts a `TrackMiddleware` or `null` for removing previously set middleware.

### Example: Applying a blur effect

The following example demonstrates how to apply a custom blur effect to the camera track using the `useCamera` hook and middleware.

```tsx
import { useCallback } from "react";
import { useCamera } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";
import { BlurProcessor } from "path-to-blur-processor"; // Adjust import based on actual implementation

function CameraWithBlurEffect() {
  const camera = useCamera();

  // Define blur middleware
  const blurMiddleware: TrackMiddleware = useCallback(
    (track: MediaStreamTrack) => {
      const stream = new MediaStream([track]);
      const blurProcessor = new BlurProcessor(stream);

      return {
        track: blurProcessor.track,
        onClear: () => blurProcessor.destroy(),
      };
    },
    []
  );

  // Check if the current middleware is blur
  const isBlurEnabled = camera.currentMiddleware === blurMiddleware;

  // Toggle blur effect
  const toggleBlur = () => {
    camera.setTrackMiddleware(isBlurEnabled ? null : blurMiddleware);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={toggleBlur}>
        {isBlurEnabled ? "Disable Blur" : "Enable Blur"}
      </button>

      {camera.stream && <video src={stream} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

This example provides a button to toggle the blur effect on and off. The `BlurProcessor` handles the actual processing logic and is assumed to be implemented elsewhere.
