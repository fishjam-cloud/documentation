# Livestreaming

If your case involves streaming live audio and/or video one-to-many with low latency, Fishjam provides the exact tools you need. This scenario is 20% cheaper than videoconferencing.

## How to start streaming?

First, you need to create a room of a special type `broadcaster`.  
As the streaming is one-to-many, you can have only one streaming participant in that room.  
To start streaming, simply use a peer token to [join the room as you would normally do](/react/connecting).

## How to receive the stream?

Fishjam SDK provides a [`useLivestream`](/api/web/functions/useLivestream) hook to receive the broadcasted stream.
In order to use it, you need to generate a viewer token using our Server SDKs (Room Manager also provides this functionality as an example).
The `useLivestream` hook will provide a [MediaStreamTrack](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack) object once the connection with Fishjam is established.

```ts
import { useLivestream } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

interface LivestreamProps {
  viewerToken: string;
}

const FISHJAM_LIVESTREAM_URL = "https://fishjam.io/api/v1/live";

export function Livestream({ viewerToken }: LivestreamProps) {
  const { connect, disconnect, stream } = useLivestream();

  useEffect(() => {
    connect({
      url: FISHJAM_LIVESTREAM_URL,
      token: viewerToken,
    });

    return () => {
      disconnect();
    };
  }, [connect, disconnect, viewerToken]);

  // stream is null until the connection is established
  if (!stream) return null;

  return <video stream={stream} />
}
```
