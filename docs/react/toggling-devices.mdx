# Toggling devices

Fishjam SDK provides functionality to control media device streams more dynamically. This includes both muting and physically turning the device on or off.

Turning off the device saves battery and CPU power and turns off the LED.
It takes longer to turn it back on, so other participants need to wait longer to receive the first data.
You would use this method with a camera, as it's usually acceptable to wait longer to see someone's face.
A disabled camera indicator reassures the user that the camera is truly turned off.

Muting and unmuting is faster, but a muted device still uses resources.
This is useful for microphones, as it is common to mute and unmute during a meeting.
Unmuting needs to be quick to capture the first word of a sentence.

Both APIs are available for camera as well as for the microphone.

## Muting and unmuting - `toggleMute()`

The toggle mute function allows you to enable or disable the media stream without affecting the device's operational status.  
If the device is muted, it starts the device, enables the media stream, and starts (or resumes) streaming.  
When it's unmuted, it disables the media stream and pauses streaming but does not stop the device.  
In the case when the device is off, it starts the device, enables the media stream, and starts (or resumes) streaming.

### Usage example

Use this function to programmatically toggle the mute state based on user interactions or other application logic.

```tsx
import { useCamera } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

function CameraControl() {
  const camera = useCamera();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => camera.toggleMute()}>Toggle camera mute</button>
  );
}
```

This component provides a button that allows users to mute or unmute the camera stream.

## Turning devices on and off - `toggleDevice()`

The toggle device function control involves physically toggling the device's operational state.  
If the device is off, it starts the device and begins (or resumes) streaming.  
When it's on, it disables the media stream, pauses streaming, and stops the device.

### Usage example

This function allows you to control the device's power state directly from your application.

```tsx
import { useMicrophone } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

function MicrophoneControl() {
  const microphone = useMicrophone();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => microphone.toggleDevice()}>Toggle microphone</button>
  );
}
```

This example provides functionality to start or stop the microphone, allowing for a complete control over the hardware from the user's interface.
