# Toggling Devices

Fishjam Cloud provides functionality to control media device streams more dynamically. This includes both soft control, such as muting, and hard control, like physically turning the device on or off.

## Soft Mode - Muting and Unmuting

Soft Mode allows you to enable or disable the media stream without affecting the device's operational status.  
If the soft mode is disabled, it starts the device, enables the media stream, and starts (or resumes) streaming.  
When it's enabled, it disables the media stream and pauses streaming but does not stop the device.  
In the case when the device is off, it starts the device, enables the media stream, and starts (or resumes) streaming.

### Usage Example

Use this function to programmatically toggle the mute state based on user interactions or other application logic.

```tsx
import { useCamera } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

function CameraControl() {
  const camera = useCamera();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => camera.toggleMute()}>Toggle camera mute</button>
  );
}
```

This component provides a button that allows users to mute or unmute the camera stream.

## Hard Mode - Turning Devices On and Off

Hard Mode control involves physically toggling the device's operational state.  
If the device is off, it starts the device and begins (or resumes) streaming.  
When it's on, it disables the media stream, pauses streaming, and stops the device.

### Usage Example

This function allows you to control the device's power state directly from your application.

```tsx
import { useMicrophone } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

function MicrophoneControl() {
  const microphone = useMicrophone();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => microphone.toggleDevice()}>Toggle microphone</button>
  );
}
```

This example provides functionality to start or stop the microphone, allowing for a complete control over the hardware from the user's interface.
