# Welcome to Fishjam

Welcome to the Fishjam documentation! Build real-time video and audio streaming applications with confidence using our organized, developer-friendly guides.

## New to Fishjam? Start here 🚀

If you're just getting started, follow our **tutorials** to build your first application:

<QuickNavigation
  items={items.filter(
    (item) =>
      item.title.toLowerCase().includes("tutorial") ||
      item.title.toLowerCase().includes("start"),
  )}
/>

### Quick Start Paths

**📱 Mobile Developer?** → [React Native Tutorial](/tutorials/react-native-quick-start)  
**🌐 Web Developer?** → [React Tutorial](/tutorials/react-quick-start)

## How This Documentation is Organized

Our documentation follows the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) to help you find exactly what you need:

### 📚 **Tutorials** - _Learn by building_

Step-by-step guides that teach you the fundamentals by building working applications.

- [React Native Quick Start](/tutorials/react-native-quick-start)
- [React Quick Start](/tutorials/react-quick-start)
- [Backend Quick Start](/tutorials/backend-quick-start)

### 🛠️ **How-to Guides** - _Solve specific problems_

Goal-oriented guides that show you how to solve real problems and implement features.

- **React Native**: [Installation](/how-to/react-native/installation), [Screen Sharing](/how-to/react-native/screensharing), [Background Streaming](/how-to/react-native/background-streaming)
- **React/Web**: [Managing Devices](/how-to/react/managing-devices), [Livestreaming](/how-to/react/livestreaming), [Custom Sources](/how-to/react/custom-sources)
- **Features**: [Audio-only Calls](/how-to/features/audio-only-calls), [Room Manager Testing](/how-to/features/room-manager-testing)
- **Backend**: [Production Deployment](/how-to/backend/production-deployment), [Server Setup](/how-to/backend/server-setup)

### 📖 **Reference** - _Look up specific information_

Technical reference for APIs, parameters, and detailed specifications.

- [React Native SDK API](/api/mobile)
- [React/Web SDK API](/api/web)
- [Server SDK API](/api/server)
- [Glossary](/reference/glossary)

### 💡 **Explanation** - _Understand the concepts_

## Get Your Development Environment Ready

1. **Create account**: [Sign up for Fishjam](https://fishjam.io/app)
2. **Get Sandbox access**: Automatic Sandbox instance with Room Manager
3. **Copy Room Manager URL**: From your developer panel
4. **Pick your platform**: Choose React Native, React, or backend first

## Common First Questions

### "Which SDK should I use?"

- **Building mobile apps?** → React Native SDK
- **Building web apps?** → React/Web SDK
- **Building backends?** → Node.js or Python Server SDK

### "Do I need my own backend?"

- **For testing**: No! Use [Room Manager](/how-to/features/room-manager-testing)
- **For production**: Yes, see [Backend Tutorial](/tutorials/backend-quick-start)

### "What room type do I need?"

- **Video calls/meetings**: `full-feature` rooms
- **Voice-only calls**: `audio-only` rooms (75% cheaper!)
- **Livestreaming/webinars**: `livestream` rooms

Learn more in [Room Types Explained](/explanation/room-types).

### "Is Fishjam secure?"

Yes! Fishjam uses a secure token-based system. Learn about [Security & Tokens](/explanation/security-tokens).

## Development vs Production

### 🧪 **Development Phase**

- Use [Room Manager](/how-to/features/room-manager-testing) for quick testing
- No backend setup required initially
- Focus on client-side features first

### 🚀 **Production Phase**

- Set up your own backend with [Server SDKs](/tutorials/backend-quick-start)
- Implement proper authentication
- Follow [production deployment guide](/how-to/backend/production-deployment)
