# Installation

## Optional: Create a New App

<details>
  <summary>Follow these steps to create a new mobile app</summary>

If you don't have an existing project, you can create a new Expo app using a template

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest my-video-app
```

As the next step, you have to generate native files with the `expo prebuild` command:

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

You can also follow more detailed [Expo instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/introduction/).

</details>

## Step 1: Install the Package

Install `@fishjam-cloud/mobile-client` with your preferred package manager.

<InstallPackage />

## Step 2: Configure App Permissions

<ConfigurePermissions />

## Optional: Request Camera and Microphone Permissions

:::info
You don’t need to explicitly request permissions as they’re automatically asked for when your app needs them.
:::

If you want more control, you can use the `useCameraPermissions` and `useMicrophonePermissions` hooks to manage permissions manually. Both hooks return an array with three elements:

1. `permission`: The current permission status
2. `requestPermission`: A function to request permission
3. `getPermission`: A function to get the current permission status

Here's an example of how to use both hooks:

```tsx
import {
  useCameraPermissions,
  useMicrophonePermissions,
} from "@fishjam-cloud/mobile-client";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const [cameraPermission, requestCameraPermission, getCameraPermission] =
  useCameraPermissions();

const [
  microphonePermission,
  requestMicrophonePermission,
  getMicrophonePermission,
] = useMicrophonePermissions();

useEffect(() => {
  requestCameraPermission();
  requestMicrophonePermission();
}, []);
```

**Permission Response**

The `permission` object has the following properties:

- `canAskAgain`: Indicates if the user can be asked again for this permission. If `false`, it is recommended to direct the user to Settings app to enable/disable the permission.
- `expires`: When the permission expires.
- `granted`: Indicates if the permission is granted.
- `status`: The current status of the permission.

:::info
You can control when and how permissions are requested by passing an `options` object to the hook.
:::

### Customizing Permission Request Behavior

By default, `get` is called automatically (auto fetch is `true`), and `request` is not (auto request is `false`). You can change this behavior:

```tsx
import { useCameraPermissions } from "@fishjam-cloud/mobile-client";
// Do not auto-fetch permission status, enable auto-request
const [permission, requestPermission] = useCameraPermissions({
  get: false, // disables auto-fetch
  request: true, // enables auto-request
});
```

Adjust these options to fit your app's needs.
