# Installation

## Optional: Create a New App

<details>
  <summary>Follow these steps to create a new mobile app</summary>

If you don't have an existing project, you can create a new Expo app using a template

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest my-video-app
```

As the next step, you have to generate native files with the `expo prebuild` command:

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

You can also follow more detailed [Expo instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/introduction/).

## Step 1: Install the Package

Install `@fishjam-cloud/mobile-client` with your preferred package manager.

<InstallPackage />

## Step 2: Configure App Permissions

<ConfigurePermissions />

## Camera and Microphone Permissions

:::info
You don't need to explicitly request permissions as they're automatically asked for when your app needs them.
:::

The SDK automatically requests camera and microphone permissions when you call `initializeDevices()`. The system permission dialog will be shown to the user if permissions haven't been granted yet.

If you need manual control over permissions, you can use the [expo-permissions](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/permissions/) or [react-native-permissions](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-permissions) libraries.
