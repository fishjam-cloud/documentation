Alongside audio and video, it is possible to send additional metadata with each peer. Metadata is just
JSON that can contain arbitrary information. Its most common use is sending a user name associated with a peer.
However, it can be also used to send the peer's camera type, application information etc.

You can also set metadata on [the server side, when adding user to the room](/production/server#metadata). This metadata is persistent throughout its lifetime and is useful for attaching information that
can't be overwritten by the peer, like information about real user names or basic permission info.
