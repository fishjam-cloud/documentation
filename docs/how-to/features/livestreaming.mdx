# Livestreaming

If your case involves streaming live audio and/or video from one source to many viewers with low latency, Fishjam provides the exact tools you need. This scenario is 20% cheaper than videoconferencing.

## How Do I Use It?

### Streamer

First, you need to create a room with the livestream type using our [Server SDKs](/how-to/backend/server-setup). If you are using our sandbox, the [Room Manager](/how-to/features/room-manager-testing) also allows you to create such a room. As the streaming is one-to-many, you can have only one streaming participant in that room.

#### Using Room Manager

You can create a livestream room and obtain a peer token using this URL:

```
https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/${ROOM_MANAGER_ID}/room-manager?roomName=foo&peerName=bar&roomType=livestream
```

#### Using Server SDKs

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
  
    ```ts
    const createdRoom = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType: 'livestream' });

    const peer = await fishjamClient.createPeer(createdRoom.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

    ```python
    options = RoomOptions(room_type="livestream")
    created_room = fishjam_client.create_room(options)

    peer = fishjam_client.create_peer(created_room.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>
 </Tabs>

Now, you can connect to the room and start streaming as described in our [React Native](/how-to/react-native/connecting) and [React](/how-to/react/connecting) docs.

:::note
Livestreaming scenario allows only one video and one audio track to be sent at a time.  
 Any additional tracks will be ignored and will not be available to the viewers.

### Viewers

To view the streamed content, you need to obtain a viewer token that can be generated using [Server SDKs](/how-to/backend/server-setup). If you are using our sandbox, the [Room Manager](/how-to/features/room-manager-testing) also allows you to create such a token.

#### Using Room Manager

```
https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/${ROOM_MANAGER_ID}/room-manager/<ROOM_NAME>/livestream-viewer-token
```

#### Using Server SDKs

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
  
    ```ts
    const viewerToken = await fishjamClient.createLivestreamViewerToken(room.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

    ```python
    viewer_token = fishjam_client.create_livestream_viewer_token(room.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>
 </Tabs>

Now you can connect the viewer to the livestream as described in our React Native and [React](/how-to/react/livestreaming) docs.

:::info
Viewers connect using [WHEP](https://blog.swmansion.com/introducing-react-native-whip-whep-ac9e5588d4da) standard, allowing the use of any player that supports the WHEP standard.
