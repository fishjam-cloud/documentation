# Audio-only Conferences and Livestreams

**How-to Guide** - _Set up voice-only communication with cost savings_

In many use cases, you only need real-time audio, without any video streaming.
If your use case falls into this category, then you can benefit greatly from using audio-only rooms in Fishjam.

## Why Should I Care?

Audio-only rooms are heavily discounted compared to normal rooms.
As described in more detail on the [pricing page](https://fishjam.io/#pricing), Fishjam rooms are priced based on the total connection time of peers in them.
Audio-only rooms come at a **75% discount** for both conferencing and livestreaming.

### Conferencing

For conferencing, the base price is $1 per 1000 participant minutes.

For example, if you have a normal room with 10 peers connected for 100 minutes, then the total cost of the room will be $1.
If the same room were audio-only, the final cost of the room would only be $0.25.

### Livestreaming

For livestreaming, the base price is $0.8 per 1000 minutes of streamer and each viewer.

In a livestream with 1 streamer and 9999 viewers, all connected for 100 minutes, the total connection time is 10,000 minutes.
For a normal livestream, this would cost $8.00.
If the same room were audio-only, the final cost would only be $2.00.

## How Do I Use It?

Using this feature is as easy as setting the `roomType` field when creating a room using our [Server SDKs](../../how-to/backend/server-setup).

:::info
Attempting to stream a video while connected to an `audio_only` or `audio_only_livestream` room will result in only the audio being sent to the other peers.
:::

### Audio-only Conferencing

Set `roomType` to `audio_only` when creating a room:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
  
    ```ts
    import { FishjamClient } from '@fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk';
    const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({
        fishjamId: "aaa",
        managementToken: "bbb",
    });
    // ---cut---
    const createdRoom = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType: 'audio_only' });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python
    options = RoomOptions(room_type="audio_only")
    created_room = fishjam_client.create_room(options)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Audio-only Livestreaming

Set `roomType` to `audio_only_livestream` when creating a room:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
  
    ```ts
    import { FishjamClient } from '@fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk';
    const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({
        fishjamId: "aaa",
        managementToken: "bbb",
    });
    // ---cut---
    const createdRoom = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType: 'audio_only_livestream' });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python
    options = RoomOptions(room_type="audio_only_livestream")
    created_room = fishjam_client.create_room(options)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now, you can connect peers normally to the room as described in our [React Native](../../how-to/react-native/connecting) and [React](../../how-to/react/connecting) docs.

:::info
The React Native and React SDKs will log a warning in the console if any attempt to add video to an audio-only room is made.
This aims to assist in debugging, as adding video to an audio-only room does nothing and is most likely a mistake.
