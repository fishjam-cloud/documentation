# How to Create Audio-only Calls

**How-to Guide** - *Set up voice-only communication with cost savings*

In many use cases, you only need real-time audio, without any video streaming.
If your use case falls into this category, then you can benefit greatly from using `audio_only` rooms in Fishjam.

{/* TODO(Tomasz Mazur): uncomment this once pricing page is ready */}
{/* ## Why Should I Care? */}
{/* Audio-only rooms are heavily discounted compared to normal rooms. */}
{/* As described in more detail on the [pricing page](https://fishjam.io/#pricing), Fishjam rooms are priced based on the total connection time of peers in them. */}
{/* Audio-only rooms come at a 75% discount. */}
{/* For example, if you have a normal room with 2 peers connected for 30 minutes, then the total cost of the room will be equal to the cost of 60 minutes. */}
{/* If the same room were audio-only, then the final cost of the room will only be equal to 15 minutes. */}

## How Do I Use It?

Using this feature is as easy as setting the `roomType` field to `audio_only` when creating a room using our [Server SDKs](/production/server)

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
  
    ```ts
    const createdRoom = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType: 'audio_only' });
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

    ```python
    options = RoomOptions(room_type="audio_only")
    created_room = fishjam_client.create_room(options)
    ```

  </TabItem>
 </Tabs>

Now, you can connect peers normally to the room as described in our [React Native](/react-native/connecting) and [React](/react/connecting) docs.

:::info
The React Native and React SDKs will log a warning in the console if any attempt to add video to an audio-only room is made.
This aims to assist in debugging, as adding video to an audio-only room does nothing and is most likely a mistake.

### Screen sharing

If you attempt to screen share when connected to an `audio_only` room, then only the audio will actually be sent to the other peers.
