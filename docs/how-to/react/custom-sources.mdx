# Custom sources

:::important

If you only wish to send camera, microphone or screen share output through Fishjam, then you most likely should refer to the documentation in [Streaming media](../../how-to/react/start-streaming) and [Managing devices](../../how-to/react/managing-devices) instead of this page.

:::

This section demonstrates how to stream non-standard video or audio to other peers in your web app.
The utilities in this section allow you to integrate Fishjam with powerful browser APIs such as [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) and [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API),
or higher level libraries, which leverage these APIs, such as [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [Smelter](https://smelter.dev) or [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/)

## Creating a custom source - [`useCustomSource()`](../../api/web/functions/useCustomSource)

To create a custom source, you only need to do two things:

1. Call the `useCustomSource` hook.
2. Call the [`setStream`](../../api/web/functions/useCustomSource#setstream) callback provided by the `useCustomSource` hook with a [MediaStream](#how-to-get-a-mediastream-object) object.

#### Usage Example

```tsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { useCustomSource } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

const stream: MediaStream | null = null; // Replace with your MediaStream object
const { setStream } = useCustomSource("my-custom-source");

useEffect(() => {
  setStream(stream);
}, [stream, setStream]);
```

### Using a created custom source

Once you have called [`setStream`](../../api/web/functions/useCustomSource#setstream) for a given source ID (in the above example, `"my-custom-source"`), any subsequent calls to `useCustomSource` with the same ID will return the same state.
This enables multiple components to control and read a shared custom source.

### Deleting a custom source

If you wish to remove a custom source, then you should call the [`setStream`](../../api/web/functions/useCustomSource#setstream) callback with `null` as its argument.

#### Usage Example

```tsx
const { setStream } = useCustomSource("my-custom-source");
// ...
await setStream(null);
```

## How to get a MediaStream object?

Depending on your use-case, the way you can obtain a [MediaStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) will vary.
Below are some common examples of how to obtain one from an existing video or audio source.

### Canvas

If you have a `<canvas>` HTML element, then you will need to call the [`captureStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/captureStream) method of the given canvas.
This is particularly useful if you are using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) or [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) to render complex animations and more.

#### Usage Example

```tsx
import React, { useCallback, useState } from "react";

export function CanvasExample() {
  const [canvasStream, setCanvasStream] = useState<MediaStream>();

  const streamFromCanvas = useCallback((canvas: HTMLCanvasElement | null) => {
    if (!canvas) return;
    setCanvasStream(canvas.captureStream());
  }, []);

  // use canvasStream as desired

  return <canvas ref={streamFromCanvas} />;
}
```

### Smelter

If you are using [Smelter](https://smelter.dev), then all you need to do is register an output via [`registerOutput`](https://smelter.dev/ts-sdk/outputs/wasm-stream/).

#### Usage Example

:::tip

If you want to see a full example React app which uses Fishjam with Smelter, then you can check out our [full example on GitHub](https://github.com/fishjam-cloud/web-client-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-client/minimal-smelter).

:::

```tsx
import React from "react";
import Smelter, { setWasmBundleUrl } from "@swmansion/smelter-web-wasm";
import { View } from "@swmansion/smelter";

setWasmBundleUrl("/assets/smelter.wasm");

async function run() {
  const smelter = new Smelter({ framerate: 30 });
  const { stream } = await smelter.registerOutput("example-output", <View />, {
    type: "stream",
    video: {
      resolution: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
    },
  });
  await smelter.init();
}
```

### Video/Audio HTML tag

If you have a `<video>` or `<audio>` element, then you need to call their [`captureStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/captureStream) method, analogously as you would with a [`canvas`](#canvas).

#### Usage Example

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="video" label="Video">

    ```tsx
    import React, { useCallback, useState } from "react";

    const hasCaptureStream = (video: HTMLVideoElement): video is HTMLVideoElement & { captureStream: () => MediaStream } => "captureStream" in video && typeof video.captureStream === "function";

    export function CanvasExample() {
      const [stream, setStream] = useState<MediaStream>();

      const streamFromVideo = useCallback((video: HTMLVideoElement | null) => {
        if (!video) return;
        if(!hasCaptureStream(video)) {
          console.warn("captureStream is not supported on this browser");
          return;
        }

        setStream(video.captureStream());
      }, []);

      // use stream as desired

      return <video ref={streamFromVideo} /* ... */ />;
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="audio" label="Audio">

    ```tsx
    import React, { useCallback, useState } from "react";

    export function CanvasExample() {
      const [stream, setStream] = useState<MediaStream>();

      const streamFromAudio = useCallback((audio: HTMLAudioElement | null) => {
        if (!audio) return;
        setStream((audio as HTMLAudioElement & { captureStream(): MediaStream }).captureStream());
      }, []);

      // use stream as desired

      return <audio ref={streamFromAudio} /* ... */ />;
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
 </Tabs>
