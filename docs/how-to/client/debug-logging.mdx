The Fishjam SDK includes a built-in debugging mode to help developers troubleshoot connectivity and media issues during development. This feature controls the verbosity of the SDK's internal logging mechanisms.

## Overview

By default, the SDK suppresses internal logs to keep your browser console clean in production environments. Enabling `debug` mode allows the SDK to output warnings and errors to the console, prefixed with `[FISHJAM]`.

## Usage

To enable debugging in a React application, pass the `debug` prop to the `FishjamProvider`.

```tsx
import React from "react";
const App = () => null;
// ---cut---
import { FishjamProvider } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

function Root() {
  return (
    <FishjamProvider
      fishjamId="your-fishjam-id"
      debug // Enable debug logs
    >
      <App />
    </FishjamProvider>
  );
}
```

We recommend toggling this based on your environment variables:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { FishjamProvider } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";
const process = {
  env: { NODE_ENV: "development", FISHJAM_ID: "your-fishjam-id" },
};
const App = () => null;
// ---cut---
<FishjamProvider
  fishjamId={process.env.FISHJAM_ID}
  debug={process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"}
>
  <App />
</FishjamProvider>;
```

## Behavior

- **Enabled (`true`):** The SDK will log internal warnings (e.g., permission errors, socket closures, signaling issues) and errors to the browser console. All logs are prefixed with `[FISHJAM]` for easy filtering.
- **Disabled (`false` or `undefined`):** The SDK operates silently, suppressing internal `console.warn` and `console.error` calls to prevent console pollution.

### Example Output

When enabled, you may see logs similar to:

```text
[FISHJAM] Socket closed with reason: ...
[FISHJAM] Couldn't get camera permission: NotAllowedError ...
[FISHJAM] ICE connection: disconnected
```
