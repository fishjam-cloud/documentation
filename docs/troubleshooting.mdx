## Supported Video Codecs

Fishjam supports the following video codecs:

- **H.264**
- **VP8**

### Changing the Codec

Override the default codec by setting the `codec` parameter when [creating a room](/api/server/interfaces/RoomConfig#videocodec) using server SDKs. Some clients may also allow codec selection on the device level.

### Why VP8 and H.264?

- **VP8**: A software-based codec supported across all devices, ensuring maximum compatibility. It's ideal for environments lacking hardware acceleration, such as Android emulators.
- **H.264**: A hardware-accelerated codec offering superior performance. However, its availability varies by device, and it may not perform optimally at lower bitrates.

For optimal performance and compatibility, assess your application's requirements and the environments in which it will operate when selecting a codec.
