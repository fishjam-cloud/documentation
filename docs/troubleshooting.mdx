# Troubleshooting

## Supported Video Codecs

Fishjam supports the following video codecs:

- **H.264**
- **VP8**

## Default Codec

Fishjam uses H.264 by default, however, for better compatibility, VP8 is set when you're using Room Manager on Sandbox.

### Changing the Codec

Override the default codec by setting the `codec` parameter when [creating a room](/api/server/interfaces/RoomConfig#videocodec) using server SDKs.

### Why VP8 and H.264?

- **VP8**: A software-based codec supported across all devices, ensuring maximum compatibility. It's ideal for environments lacking hardware acceleration, such as Android emulators.
- **H.264**: A hardware-accelerated codec offering superior performance. However, its availability varies by device, and it may not perform optimally at lower bitrates.

For optimal performance and compatibility, assess your application's requirements and the environments in which it will operate when selecting a codec.
We recommend using H.264 for production and VP8 for development as it works with Android emulators.
