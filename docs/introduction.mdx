# Getting started

Welcome to Fishjam Cloud documentation!  
Here you will find everything you need to start building your multimedia streaming applications using Fishjam Cloud.

## What is Fishjam Cloud?

Fishjam Cloud is a multimedia streaming toolkit that allows you to build real-time video and audio streaming applications using [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API).
We provide the infrastructure, media server and client SDKs so you can focus on building your apps.

**No WebRTC knowledge is required!**

## How can I try it out?

1. To get started with Fishjam Cloud, you need to create an account on our [developer panel](https://fishjam.io/app).
2. Once you have an account, Fishjam Cloud will assign you a sandbox instance automatically. Sandbox instances come with [**Room Manager**](/room-manager.md) - a simple backend for creating test rooms. Copy the _Fishjam URL_ and _Management Token_ from the developer panel.
3. Pick a client SDK that you want to use and follow the Quick Start guide. We provide SDKs for [React Native](/react-native/quick-setup.md) and [React](/react/installation.mdx).

<QuickNavigation
  items={items.filter((item) => item.title.toLowerCase().includes("setup"))}
/>

## Do you have any running examples?

We are maintaining a simple videoconferencing app called [Videoroom](https://room.fishjam.io/).
It is a publicly accessible app where you can see Fishjam Cloud in action.

You can access it at [room.fishjam.io](https://room.fishjam.io/) - just pick a room name and username and you can start a video call between any two devices.

## Any examples I can run locally?

Yes! You can find examples in our GitHub repositories that you can run locally. Examples are usually available under the `examples` directory in the relevant repository.

The easiest starting point for both web and mobile is Fishjam Chat. It is a simple chat application that uses Fishjam Cloud for video and audio streaming. You can find the code here:

- [Fishjam Chat React Native](https://github.com/fishjam-cloud/mobile-client-sdk/tree/main/examples/fishjam-chat)
- [Fishjam Chat React](https://github.com/fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk/tree/main/examples/room-manager)

## What does Fishjam Cloud consist of?

Fishjam Cloud consists of several components that work together to provide a seamless multimedia streaming experience.
Below is a list of components that you will need to get started:
