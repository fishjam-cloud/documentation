# Introduction

Welcome to the Fishjam documentation!  
Here you will find everything you need to start building your multimedia streaming applications using Fishjam.

## What is Fishjam?

Fishjam is a multimedia streaming toolkit that allows you to build real-time video and audio streaming applications using [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API).
We provide the infrastructure, media server, and client SDKs so you can focus on building your apps.

**No WebRTC knowledge is required!**

## How can I try it out?

1. To get started with Fishjam, you need to create an account on our [developer panel](https://fishjam.io/app).
2. Once you have an account, Fishjam will assign you a Sandbox instance automatically. Sandbox instances come with [**Room Manager**](/room-manager.md) - a simple backend for creating test rooms. Copy the Room Manager URL from the developer panel.
3. Pick a client SDK that you want to use and follow the Quick Start guide. We provide SDKs for [React Native](/react-native/quick-setup.mdx) and [React](/react/installation.mdx).

<QuickNavigation
  items={items.filter((item) => item.title.toLowerCase().includes("setup"))}
/>

## Do you have any running examples?

We are maintaining a simple video conferencing app called [Videoroom](https://room.fishjam.io/).
It is a publicly accessible app where you can see Fishjam in action.

You can access it at [room.fishjam.io](https://room.fishjam.io/) - just pick a room name and peer name, and you can start a video call between any two devices.

## Are there any examples I can run locally?

Absolutely! You'll find ready-to-run examples in our GitHub repositories, typically located in the `examples` directory of each project.

For both web and mobile, the easiest way to get started is with Video Room, a simple application that demonstrates video and audio streaming with Fishjam. Check out the code here:

- [Video Room React Native](https://github.com/fishjam-cloud/mobile-client-sdk/tree/main/examples/video-room)
- [Video Room React](https://github.com/fishjam-cloud/web-client-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-client/minimal-react)

## What does Fishjam consist of?

Fishjam consists of several components that work together to provide a seamless multimedia streaming experience.
Below is a list of components that you will need to get started:

| Component            | Description                                                                                                                        | Link                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Developer panel      | Developer panel for setting up your own Fishjam Media Server.                                                                      | [fishjam.io/app](https://fishjam.io/app)                                                     |
| Fishjam Media Server | A media server that will route your multimedia traffic. We host and manage it for you. You can control it via the developer panel. | â€”                                                                                            |
| Fishjam Client SDKs  | Toolkit used for multimedia integration on endpoint devices.                                                                       | [React Native](/react-native/quick-setup.mdx), [React](/react/installation.mdx)              |
| Fishjam Server SDKs  | Toolkit for integrating your backend with Fishjam. We support Python and NodeJS as well as REST API.                               | [Python, NodeJS, and REST](/production/server.mdx)                                           |
| Room Manager         | Simple backend for creating test rooms. You no longer need to bring your own backend to develop frontend apps.                     | [Repository](https://github.com/fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk/tree/main/examples/room-manager) |

## How does it work?

Streaming with Fishjam is simple. You create a room, add peers to it, and start streaming. Below is a high-level overview of how Fishjam works.
