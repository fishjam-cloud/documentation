# Room Manager Concept

**Explanation** - _Understanding what Room Manager is and why it exists_

Room Manager is a development tool that simplifies getting started with Fishjam by providing a simple backend for testing, eliminating the need to build your own server initially.

## What is Room Manager?

Room Manager is an HTTP server that comes with Fishjam's Sandbox environment. It provides basic room creation and peer management functionality without requiring you to set up your own backend infrastructure.

### Key Characteristics

- **Development-focused**: Designed for initial development and testing
- **No authentication**: Simplified access for quick prototyping
- **HTTP-based**: Simple REST API for room and peer management
- **Sandbox-only**: Only available in Sandbox environments

## The Problem Room Manager Solves

When starting with Fishjam development, you typically need:

1. **Backend server** to create rooms
2. **Authentication system** to manage users
3. **Token management** for secure peer access
4. **API endpoints** for your frontend to call

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: to test your frontend, you need a backend, but you might want to focus on frontend development first.

## Room Manager's Solution

Room Manager provides a pre-built backend so you can:

- **Start frontend development immediately**
- **Test Fishjam integration** without backend setup
- **Focus on client-side features** first
- **Prototype quickly** with minimal infrastructure

## Development vs Production Pattern

### Development Pattern (with Room Manager)

```
Client App → Room Manager → Fishjam Media Server
```

- Client directly calls Room Manager API
- No authentication required
- Simple URL-based room creation
- Perfect for prototyping and testing

### Production Pattern (your backend)

```
Client App → Your Backend → Fishjam Media Server
```

- Client calls your authenticated API
- Your backend creates rooms using Server SDKs
- Proper user authentication and authorization
- Full control over room lifecycle and permissions

## Why Room Manager is NOT for Production

### Security Limitations

- **No authentication**: Anyone with the URL can create rooms
- **Shared tokens**: Same room/peer names get identical tokens
- **Public access**: No user management or access control
- **Rate limiting**: Only 4 peers can join a room

### Functional Limitations

- **Basic features only**: Limited compared to Server SDKs
- **No customization**: Fixed behavior and responses
- **No webhooks**: No event handling capabilities
- **No advanced room configuration**: Basic room creation only

### Example Security Issue

```
// Anyone who knows this URL can join:
https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/YOUR_ID/room-manager?roomName=secret&peerName=hacker

// They get the same token as legitimate users:
{
  "peerToken": "same-token-for-same-names",
  "url": "wss://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/YOUR_ID"
}
```

## When to Use Room Manager

### ✅ Good Use Cases

- **Initial learning** and experimentation
- **Frontend development** before backend is ready
- **Proof of concepts** and demos
- **Quick testing** of Fishjam features
- **Understanding Fishjam concepts** before production planning

### ❌ Avoid for

- **Production applications** of any kind
- **User-facing demos** with real users
- **Any scenario requiring security**
- **Long-term testing environments**

## Transition Strategy

### Phase 1: Learning (Room Manager)

- Use Room Manager to understand Fishjam concepts
- Build and test your frontend components
- Experiment with different room types and features

### Phase 2: Development (Room Manager + Planning)

- Continue using Room Manager for frontend development
- Plan your production backend architecture
- Design authentication and user management systems

### Phase 3: Production (Your Backend)

- Implement backend using Server SDKs
- Replace Room Manager calls with your API calls
- Add proper authentication and security measures
- Deploy to production environment

## Relationship to Server SDKs

Room Manager is essentially a simplified application built using Fishjam Server SDKs:

```typescript
// What Room Manager does internally (simplified)
const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({ fishjamUrl, managementToken });

app.get("/room-manager", async (req, res) => {
  const { roomName, peerName, roomType } = req.query;

  // Create or get room
  const room = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType });

  // Create peer
  const { peer, peerToken } = await fishjamClient.createPeer(room.id);

  res.json({ peerToken, url: fishjamUrl });
});
```

This shows you exactly what your production backend needs to do, just with proper authentication and error handling.
