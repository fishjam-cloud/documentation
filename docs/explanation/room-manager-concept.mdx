# Room Manager Concept

_Understanding what Room Manager is and why it exists_

Room Manager is a development tool that simplifies getting started with Fishjam by providing a simple backend for testing, eliminating the need to build your own server initially.

## What is Room Manager?

Room Manager is an HTTP server that comes with Fishjam's Sandbox environment. It provides basic room creation and peer management functionality without requiring you to set up your own backend infrastructure.

### Key Characteristics

- **Development-focused**: Designed for initial development and testing
- **No authentication**: Simplified access for quick prototyping
- **HTTP-based**: Simple REST API for room and peer management
- **Sandbox-only**: Only available in Sandbox environments

## The Problem Room Manager Solves

When starting with Fishjam development, you typically need:

1. **Backend server** to create rooms
2. **Authentication system** to manage users
3. **Token management** for secure peer access
4. **API endpoints** for your frontend to call

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: to test your frontend, you need a backend, but you might want to focus on frontend development first.

## Room Manager's Solution

Room Manager provides a pre-built backend so you can:

- **Start frontend development immediately**
- **Test Fishjam integration** without backend setup
- **Focus on client-side features** first
- **Prototype quickly** with minimal infrastructure

## Relationship to Server SDKs

Room Manager is essentially a simplified application built using Fishjam Server SDKs:

```typescript
import { FishjamClient } from "@fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk";
import express from "express";
const fishjamUrl = "";
const managementToken = "";
const app = express();

// ---cut---
// What Room Manager does internally (simplified)
const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({ fishjamUrl, managementToken });

app.get(
  "/room-manager",
  async (req: express.Request, res: express.Response) => {
    const { roomName, peerName, roomType } = req.query;

    // Create or get room
    const room = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType: "conference" });

    // Create peer
    const { peer, peerToken } = await fishjamClient.createPeer(room.id);

    res.json({ peerToken, url: fishjamUrl });
  },
);
```

This shows you exactly what your production backend needs to do, just with proper authentication and error handling.
