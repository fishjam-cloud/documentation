# Security & Token Model

**Explanation** - _Understanding Fishjam's security architecture and token system_

Fishjam uses a token-based security model to ensure secure access control while keeping the developer experience simple.

## Security Architecture Overview

Fishjam's security is built on a **two-tier token system**:

1. **Management Tokens**: For backend-to-Fishjam server communication
2. **Peer Tokens**: For client-to-Fishjam server communication

This separation ensures that sensitive operations remain on your backend while allowing clients secure, limited access to media streaming.

## Management Tokens

### Purpose

Management tokens provide your backend server with administrative access to Fishjam resources. They allow creating, managing, and deleting rooms and peers.

### Characteristics

- **Long-lived**: Valid until manually regenerated
- **High privilege**: Can perform any operation on your Fishjam instance
- **Backend-only**: Never send to client applications
- **Environment-specific**: Different tokens for sandbox and production

### What Management Tokens Can Do

```typescript
import { FishjamClient, PeerId, RoomId } from "@fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk";
const fishjamUrl = "";
const managementToken = "";
const roomId = "" as unknown as RoomId;
const peerId = "" as unknown as PeerId;

// ---cut---

const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({ fishjamUrl, managementToken });

// Full administrative access:
await fishjamClient.createRoom(); // Create rooms
await fishjamClient.deleteRoom(roomId); // Delete rooms
await fishjamClient.createPeer(roomId); // Add peers
await fishjamClient.deletePeer(roomId, peerId); // Remove peers
```

### Security Best Practices

- **Environment variables**: Store in secure environment variables
- **Server-side only**: Never include in client-side code
- **Rotation**: Regenerate periodically or when compromised
- **Access control**: Limit backend server access to management tokens

### Example Secure Storage

```typescript
//@errors: 2451
// ✅ Correct: Server-side environment variable
const managementToken = process.env.FISHJAM_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN;

// ❌ Wrong: Never in client code
const managementToken = "your-management-token"; // DON'T DO THIS
```

## Peer Tokens

### Purpose

Peer tokens provide client applications with limited, time-bound access to join a specific room as a specific peer.

### Characteristics

- **Short-lived**: Expire after a reasonable time period
- **Scope-limited**: Access to one specific room only
- **Client-safe**: Safe to send to frontend applications
- **Single-use concept**: Tied to one peer identity

### What Peer Tokens Can Do

Peer tokens allow clients to:

- Connect to the specific room they were issued for
- Send and receive media streams within that room
- Access peer metadata and room state
- Participate in room activities (audio/video/screen sharing)

### What Peer Tokens Cannot Do

- Create or delete rooms
- Add or remove other peers
- Access different rooms
- Perform administrative operations
- Access management functions

### Generation Process

```typescript
import { FishjamClient, RoomId } from "@fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk";
import express from "express";
const res = {} as any;
const fishjamUrl = "";
const managementToken = "";
const roomId = "" as unknown as RoomId;
const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({ fishjamUrl, managementToken });

// ---cut---

// Backend generates peer token (using management token)
const { peer, peerToken } = await fishjamClient.createPeer(roomId, {
  metadata: { name: "John Doe", userId: "user-123" },
});

// Backend sends peer token to client
res.json({
  peerToken, // Client uses this to connect
  fishjamUrl, // Fishjam server URL
  roomId, // Room information
});
```

### Client Usage

```typescript
import { useConnection } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";
const joinRoom = {} as any;
const fishjamUrl = "";
const peerToken = "";

// ---cut---

// Client uses peer token to connect (safe to use in frontend)
await joinRoom({
  url: fishjamUrl,
  peerToken: peerToken, // This is safe in client code
});
```

## Token Lifecycle

### Management Token Lifecycle

```
Generate → Store Securely → Use in Backend → Rotate Periodically
    ↑                                              ↓
    ←──────────── Regenerate if Compromised ←──────
```

### Peer Token Lifecycle

```
Backend Request → Create Peer → Generate Token → Send to Client
                                      ↓
Client Connect → Validate Token → Join Room → Media Streaming
                                      ↓
                     Token Expires → Connection Ends
```

## Security Benefits

### Principle of Least Privilege

- **Clients**: Only get access to what they need (one room)
- **Backend**: Has administrative control but stays secure
- **Isolation**: Peers cannot interfere with other rooms or peers

### Time-bound Access

- **Automatic expiration**: Peer tokens expire automatically
- **Reduced attack window**: Short-lived tokens limit security exposure
- **Session control**: Backend controls how long clients can stay connected

### No Direct Backend Access

- **Client isolation**: Clients never access your backend credentials
- **Reduced attack surface**: Management tokens never leave your backend
- **Secure delegation**: Clients get just enough access through peer tokens

## Authentication Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Authentication

```typescript
import { FishjamClient, RoomId } from "@fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk";
import express from "express";
const fishjamUrl = "";
const managementToken = "";
const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({ fishjamUrl, managementToken });
const app = express();
const authenticateUser = {} as any;
const getOrCreateRoom = async (roomName: string) => ({
  id: "room-id" as unknown as RoomId,
});

// ---cut---

// Backend endpoint (authenticated by your system)
app.post("/join-room", authenticateUser, async (req: any, res: any) => {
  const userId = req.user.id;
  const { roomName } = req.body;

  // Create room if needed
  const room = await getOrCreateRoom(roomName);

  // Create peer with user info
  const { peer, peerToken } = await fishjamClient.createPeer(room.id, {
    metadata: {
      name: req.user.name,
      userId: userId,
      avatar: req.user.avatar,
    },
  });

  res.json({ peerToken, fishjamUrl });
});
```

### Pattern 2: Role-based Access

```typescript
import { FishjamClient, RoomId } from "@fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk";
import express from "express";
const fishjamUrl = "";
const managementToken = "";
const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({ fishjamUrl, managementToken });
const app = express();
const authenticateUser = {} as any;
const canUserJoinRoom = {} as any;
const getUserPermissions = {} as any;

// ---cut---

app.post("/join-room", authenticateUser, async (req: any, res: any) => {
  const user = req.user;
  const { roomId } = req.body;

  // Check permissions
  if (!canUserJoinRoom(user, roomId)) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: "Access denied" });
  }

  // Determine role-based metadata
  const metadata = {
    name: user.name,
    role: user.role, // 'host', 'presenter', 'participant'
    permissions: getUserPermissions(user, roomId),
  };

  const { peer, peerToken } = await fishjamClient.createPeer(
    roomId as unknown as RoomId,
    {
      metadata,
    },
  );
  res.json({ peerToken, fishjamUrl });
});
```

## Common Security Pitfalls

### ❌ Don't: Expose Management Tokens

```typescript
//@errors: 2304 18004
// DON'T: Send management token to client
res.json({
  managementToken: process.env.FISHJAM_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN, // NEVER
  peerToken,
});
```

### ❌ Don't: Store Tokens in Client Storage

```typescript
//@errors: 2304
// DON'T: Store sensitive tokens in localStorage/sessionStorage
localStorage.setItem("managementToken", token); // NEVER
```

### ❌ Don't: Use Peer Tokens for Backend Operations

```typescript
//@errors: 2304
import { FishjamClient } from "@fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk";
const fishjamUrl = "";
const peerToken = "";

// ---cut---

// DON'T: Try to create rooms with peer token
const client = new FishjamClient({ fishjamUrl, managementToken: peerToken }); // WON'T WORK
```

### ✅ Do: Validate Users Before Creating Peers

```typescript
import { FishjamClient, RoomId } from "@fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk";
import express from "express";
const fishjamUrl = "";
const managementToken = "";
const roomId = "" as unknown as RoomId;
const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({ fishjamUrl, managementToken });
const app = express();
const authenticateRequest = async (req: express.Request) => ({
  id: "user-id",
  name: "User",
});

// ---cut---

// DO: Always authenticate users in your backend
app.post("/join-room", async (req, res) => {
  // Authenticate user first
  const user = await authenticateRequest(req);
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }

  // Then create peer
  const { peer, peerToken } = await fishjamClient.createPeer(roomId, {
    metadata: { userId: user.id, name: user.name },
  });

  res.json({ peerToken, fishjamUrl });
});
```
