# Data Channels

Data channels allow you to send and receive arbitrary binary data between peers in a room. This is useful for implementing features like text chat, file sharing, game state synchronization, or real-time cursor positions.

## Prerequisites

Before using data channels, you must be [connected to a room](../how-to/client/connecting). Data channels only work after you have successfully joined a room.

## Channel Types

The SDK provides two types of data channels, each optimized for different use cases:

### Reliable Channel

- **Ordered delivery**: Messages arrive in the order they were sent
- **Guaranteed delivery**: All messages will be delivered, with automatic retransmission if needed
- **Use cases**: Chat messages, file transfers, commands, or any data that must not be lost

### Lossy Channel

- **Unordered delivery**: Messages may arrive out of order
- **No retransmission**: Messages may be dropped if the network is congested
- **Lower latency**: Faster delivery since there's no waiting for retransmissions
- **Use cases**: Real-time cursor positions, game state updates, live sensor data, or any data where the latest value matters more than every value

## Broadcast Communication

Data channels work in a **broadcast fashion** - when you publish data, it is sent to all other peers in the room. Additionally:

- Messages sent on the **reliable channel** are only received by peers subscribed to the **reliable channel**
- Messages sent on the **lossy channel** are only received by peers subscribed to the **lossy channel**

This separation allows you to use both channels simultaneously for different purposes without interference.

## Using Data Channels

Use the `useDataChannel` hook to work with data channels. The hook is available in both the web and mobile SDKs with the same API:

<Tabs groupId="platform">
  <TabItem value="web" label="React (Web)">

Use [`useDataChannel`](../api/web/functions/useDataChannel) from `@fishjam-cloud/react-client`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mobile" label="React Native (Mobile)">

Use [`useDataChannel`](../api/mobile/functions/useDataChannel) from `@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The typical flow is:

1. Initialize the data channel after connecting to a room
2. Subscribe to incoming messages
3. Publish messages to other peers
