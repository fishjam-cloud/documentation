# What is Fishjam?

**Explanation** - *Understanding the concept and purpose of Fishjam*

Fishjam is a multimedia streaming toolkit that allows you to build real-time video and audio streaming applications using [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API).
We provide the infrastructure, media server, and client SDKs so you can focus on building your apps.

**No WebRTC knowledge is required!**

## The Problem Fishjam Solves

Building real-time video and audio applications is complex. Developers typically need to:

- Set up and manage WebRTC infrastructure
- Handle complex peer-to-peer networking 
- Manage media servers and scaling
- Deal with different devices and codec compatibility
- Implement secure token-based authentication

Fishjam abstracts away this complexity, providing a simple API and managed infrastructure.

## What Fishjam Provides

Fishjam consists of several components that work together to provide a seamless multimedia streaming experience:

| Component            | Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Developer panel      | Developer panel for setting up your own Fishjam Media Server.                                                                      |
| Fishjam Media Server | A media server that will route your multimedia traffic. We host and manage it for you. You can control it via the developer panel. |
| Fishjam Client SDKs  | Toolkit used for multimedia integration on endpoint devices.                                                                       |
| Fishjam Server SDKs  | Toolkit for integrating your backend with Fishjam. We support Python and NodeJS as well as REST API.                               |
| Room Manager         | Simple backend for creating test rooms. You no longer need to bring your own backend to develop frontend apps.                     |

## Use Cases

Fishjam is ideal for:

### Video Conferencing
Build Zoom-like applications with multiple participants in rooms, screen sharing, and audio/video controls.

### Livestreaming  
Stream live content from one broadcaster to many viewers with low latency, perfect for webinars, live events, or streaming platforms.

### Audio-only Applications
Create voice-only experiences like audio conferencing, podcasts, or voice chat applications.

## Key Benefits

### üöÄ **Fast Development**
Get started quickly with our SDKs and Room Manager for testing - no backend setup required initially.

### üîß **No WebRTC Expertise Needed**  
Our SDKs handle all the WebRTC complexity, codec negotiations, and networking.

### üì± **Cross-platform**
Works on React Native (iOS/Android), React/Web, and server-side environments.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Secure by Default**
Token-based authentication and secure media routing built-in.

### üí∞ **Cost-effective**
Pay only for what you use, with special pricing for audio-only rooms.

## How It Differs from Alternatives

Unlike pure WebRTC solutions, Fishjam provides:
- Managed infrastructure (no server setup required)
- Simple APIs (no WebRTC knowledge needed)  
- Built-in scaling and reliability
- Multiple room types optimized for different use cases

Unlike generic streaming platforms, Fishjam offers:
- Real-time, low-latency communication
- Full control over your application experience
- Developer-friendly APIs and SDKs
- Flexible room management
