# What is Fishjam?

_Understanding the concept and purpose of Fishjam_

Fishjam is a multimedia streaming toolkit that allows you to build real-time video and audio streaming applications using [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API).
We provide the infrastructure, media server, and client SDKs so you can focus on building your apps.

**No WebRTC knowledge is required!**

## The Problem Fishjam Solves

Building real-time video and audio applications is complex. Developers typically need to:

- Set up and manage WebRTC infrastructure
- Handle complex peer-to-peer networking
- Manage media servers and scaling
- Deal with different devices and codec compatibility
- Implement secure token-based authentication

Fishjam abstracts away this complexity, providing a simple API and managed infrastructure.

## What Fishjam Provides

Fishjam consists of several components that work together to provide a seamless multimedia streaming experience:

| Component            | Description                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Developer panel      | Developer panel for setting up your own Fishjam Media Server.                                           |
| Fishjam Media Server | A media server that will route your multimedia traffic. We host and manage it for you.                  |
| Fishjam Client SDKs  | Toolkit used for multimedia integration on endpoint devices.                                            |
| Fishjam Server SDKs  | Toolkit for integrating your backend with Fishjam. We support Python and NodeJS as well as REST API.    |
| Room Manager         | Simple backend for creating test rooms. You can test Fishjam without having to set up your own backend. |

## Use Cases

Fishjam is ideal for:

### Video Conferencing

Build Zoom-like applications with multiple participants in rooms, screen sharing, and audio/video controls.

### Livestreaming

Stream live content from one broadcaster to many viewers with low latency, perfect for webinars, live events, or streaming platforms.

### Audio-only Applications

Create voice-only experiences like audio conferencing, podcasts, or voice chat applications.
