# Room Types Explained

_Understanding different types of rooms and when to use them_

Fishjam provides three distinct room types, each optimized for different use cases and scenarios. Understanding these room types helps you choose the right approach for your application.

## Conference Rooms (Default)

### What are Conference Rooms?

Conference rooms are the default room type designed for multi-participant video conferencing scenarios. They support all Fishjam features and provide the most flexibility.

### Key Characteristics

- **Multi-participant**: Support for many participants simultaneously
- **Bidirectional media**: All participants can send and receive video/audio
- **Rich features**: Screen sharing, multiple video tracks, audio controls
- **Flexible track management**: Participants can add/remove tracks dynamically

### Best Use Cases

- **Video conferencing applications** (Zoom-like experiences)
- **Virtual meetings** with screen sharing
- **Collaborative workspaces** with multiple media types
- **Interactive webinars** with participant engagement

### Cost Considerations

Conference rooms are priced based on total connection time of all peers.

## Audio-only Rooms

### What are Audio-only Rooms?

Audio-only rooms are optimized specifically for voice communication, removing video capabilities to improve performance and reduce costs.

### Key Characteristics

- **Voice-only communication**: No video tracks allowed
- **Optimized bandwidth**: Reduced network usage
- **Better performance**: Lower CPU and battery usage
- **Higher capacity**: Support for more simultaneous participants

### Best Use Cases

- **Voice-only conferencing** and calls
- **Podcast recording** with multiple participants
- **Audio chat applications**
- **Large-scale audio events** (town halls, announcements)

### Cost Benefits

Audio-only rooms come at a **75% discount** compared to conference rooms:

- 2 peers for 30 minutes = 60 minutes total time in conference room
- Same scenario in audio-only room = 15 minutes equivalent cost

### Video Behavior in Audio-only Rooms

If you attempt to add video to an audio-only room:

- Video tracks are ignored (not transmitted)
- SDKs log warnings to help with debugging
- Only audio from screen sharing is transmitted
- No errors thrown, graceful degradation

## Livestream Rooms

### What are Livestream Rooms?

Livestream rooms are designed for one-to-many livestreaming scenarios where a single streamer streams to multiple viewers.

### Key Characteristics

- **One sender**: Only one streamer can send media
- **Many receivers**: Unlimited viewers can watch
- **Optimized for scale**: Efficient distribution architecture
- **Low latency**: Optimized for real-time and interactive livestreaming

### Livestreaming Limitations

- **Single video track**: Only one video stream allowed
- **Single audio track**: Only one audio stream allowed
- **Additional tracks ignored**: Extra tracks are not forwarded to viewers

### Viewer Experience

- **Configurable access**: Livestreams can either be public, where anyone with the stream's ID can join, or private, where every viewer needs a token
- **Standard compatibility**: Any [WHEP](https://blog.swmansion.com/building-interactive-streaming-apps-webrtc-whip-whep-explained-d38f4825ec90)-compatible player works

### Best Use Cases

- **Live events** and webinars
- **Streaming platforms** and content distribution
- **Corporate livestreams** and announcements
- **Sports and entertainment** streaming

### Cost Benefits

Livestream rooms are **cheaper** than conference rooms for equivalent usage, because there is only one streamer.

## Choosing the Right Room Type

### Decision Matrix

| Use Case                            | Room Type  | Why                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Classic video meetings              | Conference | Multiple video sources                      |
| Voice-only meetings                 | Audio-only | Cheapest and most performant option         |
| Podcasts                            | Audio-only | Cheapest and most performant option         |
| Webinar (1 presenter, many viewers) | Livestream | Highly scalable and cheaper than conference |
| Interactive workshop                | Conference | Multiple video sources                      |

### Performance Considerations

#### Network Bandwidth

- **Conference**: Highest bandwidth usage
- **Audio-only**: Lowest bandwidth usage
- **Livestream**: Moderate for streamer, low for viewers

#### Server Resources

- **Conference**: Highest server resource usage
- **Audio-only**: Lowest server resource usage
- **Livestream**: Optimized for many viewers

#### Client Performance

- **Conference**: Higher CPU/battery usage
- **Audio-only**: Lowest resource usage
- **Livestream**: Low for viewers, normal for streamer

### Migration Between Room Types

Room types are set at creation time and cannot be changed:

- Each room has a fixed type for its entire lifecycle
- To change types, you must create a new room
