# Room Types Explained

**Explanation** - _Understanding different types of rooms and when to use them_

Fishjam provides three distinct room types, each optimized for different use cases and scenarios. Understanding these room types helps you choose the right approach for your application.

## Full-feature Rooms (Default)

### What are Full-feature Rooms?

Full-feature rooms are the default room type designed for multi-participant video conferencing scenarios. They support all Fishjam features and provide the most flexibility.

### Key Characteristics

- **Multi-participant**: Support for many participants simultaneously
- **Bidirectional media**: All participants can send and receive video/audio
- **Rich features**: Screen sharing, multiple video tracks, audio controls
- **Flexible track management**: Participants can add/remove tracks dynamically

### Architecture

Full-feature rooms use a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) architecture:

- Each participant sends their media to Fishjam Media Server
- Server selectively forwards streams to other participants
- Efficient bandwidth usage compared to mesh networking
- Quality adaptation based on network conditions

### Best Use Cases

- **Video conferencing applications** (Zoom-like experiences)
- **Virtual meetings** with screen sharing
- **Collaborative workspaces** with multiple media types
- **Interactive webinars** with participant engagement

### Cost Considerations

Full-feature rooms are priced based on total connection time of all peers.

## Audio-only Rooms

### What are Audio-only Rooms?

Audio-only rooms are optimized specifically for voice communication, removing video capabilities to improve performance and reduce costs.

### Key Characteristics

- **Voice-only communication**: No video tracks allowed
- **Optimized bandwidth**: Reduced network usage
- **Better performance**: Lower CPU and battery usage
- **Higher capacity**: Support for more simultaneous participants

### Architecture

- Similar to full-feature rooms but audio-only routing
- Optimized audio processing and codec selection
- Reduced server resources per participant
- Enhanced audio quality algorithms

### Best Use Cases

- **Voice-only conferencing** and calls
- **Podcast recording** with multiple participants
- **Audio chat applications**
- **Large-scale audio events** (town halls, announcements)

### Cost Benefits

Audio-only rooms come at a **75% discount** compared to full-feature rooms:

- 2 peers for 30 minutes = 60 minutes total time in full-feature room
- Same scenario in audio-only room = 15 minutes equivalent cost

### Video Behavior in Audio-only Rooms

If you attempt to add video to an audio-only room:

- Video tracks are ignored (not transmitted)
- SDKs log warnings to help with debugging
- Only audio from screen sharing is transmitted
- No errors thrown, graceful degradation

## Livestream Rooms

### What are Livestream Rooms?

Livestream rooms are designed for one-to-many broadcasting scenarios where a single broadcaster streams to multiple viewers.

### Key Characteristics

- **One broadcaster**: Only one peer can send media
- **Many viewers**: Unlimited viewers can watch
- **Optimized for scale**: Efficient distribution architecture
- **Low latency**: Optimized for real-time broadcasting
- **WHEP compatibility**: Standards-based viewer connections

### Architecture

- **Broadcaster**: Sends video/audio using standard Fishjam client SDKs
- **Viewers**: Connect using WHEP (WebRTC-HTTP Egress Protocol)
- **Media distribution**: Optimized server-side distribution
- **Geographic distribution**: Edge servers for global reach

### Broadcasting Limitations

- **Single video track**: Only one video stream allowed
- **Single audio track**: Only one audio stream allowed
- **Additional tracks ignored**: Extra tracks are not forwarded to viewers

### Viewer Experience

- **Token-based access**: Viewers need special viewer tokens
- **Standard compatibility**: Any WHEP-compatible player works
- **Automatic quality**: Adaptive streaming based on viewer connection

### Best Use Cases

- **Live events** and webinars
- **Streaming platforms** and content distribution
- **Corporate broadcasts** and announcements
- **Educational content** delivery
- **Sports and entertainment** streaming

### Cost Benefits

Livestream rooms are **cheaper** than full-feature rooms for equivalent usage, because there is only one broadcaster.

## Choosing the Right Room Type

### Decision Matrix

| Use Case                            | Room Type    | Why                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Video meetings with 2-10 people     | Full-feature | Bidirectional video, screen sharing      |
| Large video conference (10+ people) | Full-feature | Multi-participant support                |
| Voice-only meetings                 | Audio-only   | Cost savings, better performance         |
| Podcast recording                   | Audio-only   | Audio focus, multiple participants       |
| Webinar (1 presenter, many viewers) | Livestream   | One-to-many, cost effective              |
| Live event streaming                | Livestream   | Scalable viewing, optimized distribution |
| Interactive workshop                | Full-feature | Participant engagement, screen sharing   |

### Performance Considerations

#### Network Bandwidth

- **Full-feature**: Highest bandwidth usage
- **Audio-only**: Lowest bandwidth usage
- **Livestream**: Moderate for broadcaster, low for viewers

#### Server Resources

- **Full-feature**: Highest server resource usage
- **Audio-only**: Lowest server resource usage
- **Livestream**: Optimized for many viewers

#### Client Performance

- **Full-feature**: Higher CPU/battery usage
- **Audio-only**: Lowest resource usage
- **Livestream**: Low for viewers, normal for broadcaster

### Migration Between Room Types

Room types are set at creation time and cannot be changed:

- Each room has a fixed type for its entire lifecycle
- To change types, create a new room
- Plan your room type choice carefully

### Development vs Production

For development, you can create any room type using [Room Manager](/how-to/features/room-manager-testing).

For production, room types are specified when creating rooms via [Server SDKs](/how-to/backend/server-setup):

```typescript
import { FishjamClient } from "@fishjam-cloud/js-server-sdk";
const fishjamUrl = "";
const managementToken = "";
const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({ fishjamUrl, managementToken });

// ---cut---

// Full-feature room (default)
const fullRoom = await fishjamClient.createRoom();

// Audio-only room
const audioRoom = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType: "audio_only" });

// Livestream room
const liveRoom = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType: "livestream" });
```
