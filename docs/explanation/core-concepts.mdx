# Core Concepts

**Explanation** - _Essential concepts you need to understand to work with Fishjam_

Understanding these core concepts will help you design and build applications with Fishjam more effectively.

## Rooms

### What is a Room?

A **room** is a logical container that groups participants together for multimedia communication. Think of it as a virtual meeting space where peers can join to share audio and video.

### Room Characteristics

- **Unique identity**: Each room has a unique ID
- **Type-specific**: Room type (full-feature, audio-only, livestream) is set at creation
- **Isolated**: Participants in different rooms cannot interact
- **Temporary**: Rooms exist only while needed, can be deleted when empty

### Room Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Backend creates room using Server SDK
2. **Population**: Peers are added to the room
3. **Activity**: Peers connect and communicate
4. **Cleanup**: Room is deleted when no longer needed

## Peers

### What is a Peer?

A **peer** represents a single participant in a room. Each peer corresponds to one client connection (e.g., one user's phone or browser).

### Peer Characteristics

- **Unique within room**: Each peer has a unique ID within their room
- **Associated metadata**: Custom data attached when creating the peer
- **Track ownership**: Peers own the tracks (audio/video streams) they send
- **State management**: Connection status, track states

### Peer Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Backend creates peer in a room (gets peer token)
2. **Connection**: Client uses peer token to connect to room
3. **Media sharing**: Peer sends/receives tracks
4. **Disconnection**: Peer leaves room or connection drops
5. **Cleanup**: Peer is removed from room

## Tracks

### What is a Track?

A **track** represents a single stream of media data - either audio or video. Each track carries one type of media from one source.

### Track Types

- **Video tracks**: Camera feed, screen sharing, custom video
- **Audio tracks**: Microphone, system audio, custom audio

### Track Characteristics

- **Owned by peers**: Each track belongs to one peer
- **Typed**: Video or audio, cannot change type
- **Stateful**: Active/inactive, enabled/disabled
- **Metadata**: Description, source information

### Track Examples

- Camera from user's phone → Video track
- Microphone from user's computer → Audio track
- Screen sharing → Video track (screen content)
- Shared app audio → Audio track (application sound)

## Tokens

### Management Tokens

**Management tokens** are long-lived credentials that authorize your backend to control Fishjam resources.

#### Characteristics

- **Backend-only**: Never expose to client applications
- **Long-lived**: Remain valid until regenerated
- **Full access**: Can create/delete rooms and peers
- **Environment-specific**: Different tokens for sandbox vs production

#### Usage

```typescript
const fishjamClient = new FishjamClient({
  fishjamUrl,
  managementToken: process.env.MANAGEMENT_TOKEN,
});
```

### Peer Tokens

**Peer tokens** are short-lived credentials that allow client applications to join specific rooms.

#### Characteristics

- **Client-safe**: Safe to send to frontend applications
- **Short-lived**: Expire after reasonable time period
- **Room-specific**: Grant access to one specific room only
- **Peer-specific**: Tied to one peer identity

#### Generation

```typescript
// Backend generates peer token
const { peer, peerToken } = await fishjamClient.createPeer(roomId, {
  metadata: { name: "John Doe" },
});

// Send to client
response.json({ peerToken, fishjamUrl });
```

#### Usage

```typescript
// Client uses peer token to connect
await joinRoom({ url: fishjamUrl, peerToken });
```

## Metadata

### What is Metadata?

**Metadata** is custom data associated with peers that other participants can read. It's set when creating a peer and cannot be changed afterward.

### Use Cases

- **User information**: Names, avatars, roles
- **Application state**: User preferences, permissions
- **Custom identifiers**: External user IDs, session data

### Example

```typescript
// Backend sets metadata when creating peer
const { peer, peerToken } = await fishjamClient.createPeer(roomId, {
  metadata: {
    name: "Alice Johnson",
    role: "presenter",
    avatar: "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
    userId: "user-123",
  },
});
```

```typescript
// Clients can read metadata of all peers
const { remotePeers } = usePeers();
remotePeers.forEach((peer) => {
  console.log(peer.metadata.name); // "Alice Johnson"
});
```

## Media Flow Architecture

### Client-Server-Client Pattern

Fishjam uses a **Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)** architecture:

1. **Upload**: Each peer sends their media to Fishjam servers
2. **Processing**: Server processes, adapts quality, applies policies
3. **Distribution**: Server forwards media to other peers in the room
4. **Download**: Each peer receives media from other participants

### Benefits of SFU Architecture

- **Bandwidth efficiency**: Each client uploads once, server handles distribution
- **Quality adaptation**: Server can adjust quality per recipient
- **Selective forwarding**: Server can choose which streams to forward
- **Scalability**: Adding participants doesn't exponentially increase bandwidth

## Connection States

### Peer Connection States

Understanding connection states helps with UI and error handling:

- **`connecting`**: Attempting to join room
- **`connected`**: Successfully connected and ready
- **`reconnecting`**: Temporarily disconnected, attempting to reconnect
- **`disconnected`**: Permanently disconnected from room

### Track States

Tracks also have states that affect media flow:

- **`active`**: Track is sending/receiving media
- **`inactive`**: Track exists but no media flowing
- **`enabled`**: Track is enabled (user choice)
- **`disabled`**: Track is disabled (user choice)

## Room vs Peer vs Track Hierarchy

```
Room (container)
├── Peer 1 (participant)
│   ├── Video Track (camera)
│   ├── Audio Track (microphone)
│   └── Video Track (screen share)
├── Peer 2 (participant)
│   ├── Video Track (camera)
│   └── Audio Track (microphone)
└── Peer 3 (participant)
    └── Audio Track (microphone only)
```

## Data Flow Example

Here's a complete example of how these concepts work together:

### 1. Room Setup (Backend)

```typescript
// Create room
const room = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType: "full-feature" });

// Add peer for Alice
const { peer: alicePeer, peerToken: aliceToken } =
  await fishjamClient.createPeer(room.id, {
    metadata: { name: "Alice", role: "host" },
  });

// Add peer for Bob
const { peer: bobPeer, peerToken: bobToken } = await fishjamClient.createPeer(
  room.id,
  {
    metadata: { name: "Bob", role: "participant" },
  },
);
```

### 2. Client Connection

```typescript
// Alice's client connects
await joinRoom({ url: fishjamUrl, peerToken: aliceToken });

// Bob's client connects
await joinRoom({ url: fishjamUrl, peerToken: bobToken });
```

### 3. Media Sharing

- Alice starts camera → Creates video track
- Alice starts microphone → Creates audio track
- Bob starts microphone → Creates audio track
- Bob receives Alice's video and audio tracks
- Alice receives Bob's audio track
