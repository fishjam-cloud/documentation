## Supported Video Codecs

Fishjam currently supports the following video codecs:

- **H.264**
- **VP8**

### Default Codec Behavior

- **Sandbox environment**: Defaults to **VP8**.
- **Production environment**: Defaults to **H.264**.

### Changing the Codec

You can override the default codec by setting the `codec` parameter when [creating a room](/api/server/interfaces/RoomConfig#videocodec) using server SDKs.

### Why VP8 and H.264?

- **VP8**: A software codec supported by all devices, making it the most compatible choice.
- **H.264**: A hardware codec that offers better performance but is not supported in some environments, such as Android emulators.

For optimal compatibility, choose VP8 when running in environments where hardware acceleration is unavailable.
