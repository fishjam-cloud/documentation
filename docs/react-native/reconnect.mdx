# Reconnect

If your connection is lost while you are connected to a room, the app will automatically handle the reconnection process.
You can monitor these events by utilizing the [`useConnection`](/api/mobile/functions/useConnection) hook.

### Example hook that logs the current status to the console:

```ts
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import {
  ConnectionStatus,
  useConnection,
} from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

export function useLogConnectionStatus() {
  const prevStatus = useRef<ConnectionStatus>("idle");

  // highlight-next-line
  const { reconnectionStatus } = useConnection();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (prevStatus.current === reconnectionStatus) return;
    prevStatus.current = reconnectionStatus;

    switch (reconnectionStatus) {
      case "error":
        return console.log("Failed to reconnect");
      case "reconnecting":
        return console.log("Connection is broken, reconnecting...");
      default:
        return console.log("Connected successfully");
    }
  }, [reconnectionStatus]);
}
```
