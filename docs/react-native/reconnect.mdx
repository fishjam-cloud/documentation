# Reconnect

If your connection is lost while you are connected to a room, the app will automatically handle the reconnection process. You can monitor these events by utilizing the `useReconnection` hook.

### Example hook that logs the current status to the console:

```ts
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import {
  ReconnectionStatus,
  useReconnection,
} from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

function useLogReconnectionStatus() {
  const prevStatus = useRef<ReconnectionStatus>("idle");
  const { reconnectionStatus } = useReconnection();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (prevStatus.current === reconnectionStatus) return;
    prevStatus.current = reconnectionStatus;

    switch (reconnectionStatus) {
      case "error":
        return console.log("Failed to reconnect");
      case "reconnecting":
        return console.log("Connection is broken, reconnecting...");
      default:
        return console.log("Connected succesfully");
    }
  }, [reconnectionStatus]);
}
```
