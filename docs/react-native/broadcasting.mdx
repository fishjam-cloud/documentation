# Broadcasting

:::info

This guide assumes you already finished either the [Quick Setup](/react-native/quick-setup) or [Installation](/react-native/installation) guide.

:::

You can also use Fishjam to broadcast your content to users.

In order to do this you need to create two flows.

1. The first flow will be used to broadcast the content.
2. The second flow will be used to receive the content.

## Broadcasting

Here is an example of a very simple broadcaster that immediately broadcasts the front camera to all users in a room:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import {
  useCamera,
  useConnection,
  VideoPreviewView,
} from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

export function Broadcaster() {
  const { prepareCamera } = useCamera();
  const { joinRoom, leaveRoom } = useConnection();

  useEffect(() => {
    const startBroadcasting = async () => {
      await prepareCamera({ cameraEnabled: true });

      const { url, peerToken } = await getRoomDetails(
        "RoomName",
        "BroadcastingUserName",
      );

      await joinRoom({ url, peerToken });
      console.log("Broadcasting...");
    };

    startBroadcasting();
    return () => {
      leaveRoom();
    };
  }, [prepareCamera, joinRoom, leaveRoom]);

  return (
    <VideoPreviewView
      style={{ width: "90%", aspectRatio: 1, alignSelf: "center" }}
    />
  );
}

async function getRoomDetails(roomName: string, peerName: string) {
  // This will work ONLY for the Sandbox App
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/${YOUR_APP_ID}/room-manager/?roomName=${roomName}&peerName=${peerName}`,
  );
  return response.json();
}
```

## Receiving

Here is an example of a very simple receiver that receives the content from the broadcaster:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import {
  useConnection,
  usePeers,
  VideoRendererView,
} from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

export function Receiver() {
  const { joinRoom, leaveRoom } = useConnection();
  const { remotePeers } = usePeers();

  const broadcastedTrack = remotePeers.at(0)?.cameraTrack;

  useEffect(() => {
    const startReceiving = async () => {
      const { url, peerToken } = await getRoomDetails(
        "RoomName",
        "ReceivingUserName",
      );
      await joinRoom({ url, peerToken });
      console.log("Receiving...");
    };

    startReceiving();

    return () => {
      leaveRoom();
    };
  }, [joinRoom, leaveRoom]);

  if (!broadcastedTrack) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
      <VideoRendererView
        key={broadcastedTrack.id}
        trackId={broadcastedTrack.id}
        videoLayout="FIT"
        style={{ width: "90%", aspectRatio: 1, backgroundColor: "black" }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

async function getRoomDetails(roomName: string, peerName: string) {
  // This will work ONLY for the Sandbox App
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/${YOUR_APP_ID}/room-manager/?roomName=${roomName}&peerName=${peerName}`,
  );
  return response.json();
}
```
