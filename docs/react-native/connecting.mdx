# Connecting

This article will guide you through the process of connecting to a Fishjam room.

## Getting URL and token

In order to connect, you need to retrieve the **Fishjam URL** and **Peer Token** (the token that will authenticate the peer in
your Room).

<Tabs groupId="app-type">

  <TabItem value="sandbox" label="Sandbox App">

Once you get your account on [Fishjam](https://fishjam.io), you will have access to the Sandbox App. This app comes
with a pre-configured test service called [Room Manager](/room-manager). This is basically a service that will create a Room, add your app as
the Room's Peer, and return the token required to use that Room.

To use that, simply call `fetch`:

```ts
const ROOM_MANAGER_ID = "..."; // Check https://fishjam.io/app/ for your Room Manager ID
const roomName = "room";
const peerName = "user";
// ---cut---
const response = await fetch(
  `https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/${ROOM_MANAGER_ID}room-manager/?roomName=${roomName}&peerName=${peerName}`,
);

const { fishjamUrl, peerToken } = await response.json();
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="production" label="Production App">

For the production app, you need to implement your own backend service that will provide the user with a **Peer Token**. To do that,
follow our [server setup instructions](/production/server).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Connecting

In order to connect, call [`joinRoom`](/api/mobile/functions/useConnection#joinroom) method with data from the previous step:

```tsx
import React, { useCallback } from "react";
import { Button } from "react-native";
import { useConnection } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

// Check https://fishjam.io/app/ for your Room Manager ID
const ROOM_MANAGER_ID = "...";

export function JoinRoomButton() {
  const { joinRoom } = useConnection(); // [!code highlight]

  const onPressJoin = useCallback(async () => {
    const { url, peerToken } = await getRoomDetails("Room", "User");

    await joinRoom({ url, peerToken }); // [!code highlight]
  }, [joinRoom]);

  return <Button onPress={onPressJoin} title="Join Room" />;
}

async function getRoomDetails(roomName: string, peerName: string) {
  // This will work ONLY for the Sandbox App
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/${ROOM_MANAGER_ID}/room-manager/?roomName=${roomName}&peerName=${peerName}`,
  );
  const { fishjamUrl, peerToken } = await response.json();
  return { url: fishjamUrl, peerToken };
}
```

## Disconnecting

In order to close the connection, you have to call [`leaveRoom`](/api/mobile/functions/useConnection#leaveroom) method.

```tsx
import React, { useCallback } from "react";
import { Button } from "react-native";
import { useConnection } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

export function LeaveRoomButton() {
  const { leaveRoom } = useConnection(); // [!code highlight]

  const onPressLeave = useCallback(async () => {
    await leaveRoom(); // [!code highlight]
  }, [leaveRoom]);

  return <Button onPress={onPressLeave} title="Leave Room" />;
}
```
