# Connecting

This article will guide you through the process of connecting to a Fishjam room.

## Getting URL and token

In order to connect, you need to retrieve `FISHJAM_URL` (multimedia server address) and `PEER_TOKEN` (token that will authenticate the peer in
your Room).

<Tabs groupId="app-type">

  <TabItem value="sandbox" label="Sandbox App">

Once you get your account on [Fishjam](https://fishjam.io), you will have access to Sandbox App. This app comes
with pre-configured test service called Room Manager. This is basically service that will create Room, add your app as
Room's Peer and return token required to use that Room.

To use that simply call `fetch`:

```ts
const response = await fetch(
  `https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/${YOUR_ID}/room-manager/?roomName=${roomName}&peerName=${peerName}`,
);

const { fishjamUrl, peerToken } = await response.json();
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="production" label="Production App">

For production app, you need to implement your own backend service that will provide user with `PEER_TOKEN`. To do that,
follow our [server setup instructions](/production/server).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Connecting

In order to connect, call [`joinRoom`](/api/mobile/functions/useConnection#joinroom) method with data from previous step:

```tsx
import { useCallback } from "react";
import { Button } from "react-native";
import { useConnection } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

// check https://cloud.fishjam.work/app/ for your app ID
const YOUR_APP_ID = "...";

export function JoinRoomButton() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const { joinRoom } = useConnection();

  const onPressJoin = useCallback(async () => {
    const { fishjamUrl, peerToken } = await getRoomDetails("Room", "User");

    // highlight-next-line
    await joinRoom(fishjamUrl, peerToken);
  }, [joinRoom]);

  return <Button onPress={onPressJoin} title="Join Room" />;
}

async function getRoomDetails(roomName: string, peerName: string) {
  // this will work ONLY for sandbox app
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/${YOUR_APP_ID}/room-manager/?roomName=${roomName}&peerName=${peerName}`,
  );
  const { fishjamUrl, peerToken } = await response.json();
  return { fishjamUrl, peerToken };
}
```

## Disconnecting

In order to close the connection, you have to call [`leaveRoom`](/api/mobile/functions/useConnection#leaveroom) method.

```tsx
import { useCallback } from "react";
import { Button } from "react-native";
import { useConnection } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

export function LeaveRoomButton() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const { leaveRoom } = useConnection();

  const onPressLeave = useCallback(async () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    await leaveRoom();
  }, [leaveRoom]);

  return <Button onPress={onPressLeave} title="Leave Room" />;
}
```
