How to connect to Fishjam Cloud

## Getting URL and token

In order to connect, you need to retrieve URL (multimedia server address) and token (token that will authenticate you in
your Room)

<Tabs groupId="app-type">

  <TabItem value="sandbox" label="Sandbox App">

Once you get your account on [Fishjam Cloud](https://fishjam.io), you will have access to Sandbox App. This app comes
with pre-configured test service called Room Manager. This is basically service that will create Room, add your app as
Room's Peer and return token required to use that Room.

To use that simply call `fetch`:

```ts
const response = await fetch(
  `https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/*YOUR_ID*/room-manager/?roomName=*ROOM_NAME*&peerName=*USER_NAME*`,
);

const { fishjamUrl, peerToken } = await response.json();
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="production" label="Production App">

For production app, you need to implement your own backend service that will provide user with `peerToken`. To do that,
follow our [server setup instructions](/production/server).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Connecting

In order to connect, you just need to call `joinRoom` method with data from previous step:

```ts
import { joinRoom } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

await joinRoom(fishjamUrl, peerToken);
```

## Disconnecting

In order to close connection, you have to call `leaveRoom` method.

```ts
import { leaveRoom } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

await leaveRoom();
```
