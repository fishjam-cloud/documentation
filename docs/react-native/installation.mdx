# Installation

## Optional: Create a New App

<details>
  <summary>Follow these steps to create a new mobile app</summary>

If you don't have an existing project, you can create a new Expo app using a template

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest my-video-app
```

As the next step, you have to generate native files with the `expo prebuild` command:

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

You can also follow more detailed [Expo instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/introduction/).

## Step 1: Install the Package

Install `@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client` with your preferred package manager.

<InstallPackage />

## Step 2: Configure App Permissions

<ConfigurePermissions />

## Step 3: Request App Permissions

Before using the camera or microphone, ask the user for permissions.

```tsx
import { useCameraPermissions } from "expo-camera";
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

const [permission, requestPermission] = useCameraPermissions();

useEffect(() => {
  requestPermission();
}, []);
```
