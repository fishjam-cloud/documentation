# Start streaming

How to stream your camera

:::tip[Enable devices before connecting]

You can enable your camera and microphone before calling connect method.
This way, you can show user camera preview. Once connect method is called,
enabled camera and microphone will start streaming to Room.

:::

## Enable your camera

First, you have to enable your camera by calling `prepareCamera` method.
You can open show camera preview with `VideoPreviewView` component

```ts
import { useCamera, VideoPreviewView } from '@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client';

function Component() {
  const { prepareCamera } = useCamera();

  useEffect(() => {
    prepareCamera({ enableCamera: true });
  }, [])

  return <VideoPreviewView />
}
```

### Listing user cameras

To list all cameras available on device, you can use `cameraList` property from `useCamera` hook.
This way, you can either automatically choose camera (front/back) or allow user to select camera type.

To change camera, simply call `switchCamera` method.

```ts
const { cameraList, switchCamera, currentCamera } = useCamera();

const flipCamera = () => {
  const otherCamera = cameraList.find(
    (camera) => camera.facingDirection !== currentCamera?.facingDirection,
  );
  if (otherCamera) switchCamera(camera.id);
};
```

### Disabling/enabling camera

To change camera state, you use `toggleCamera` method.

```ts
const { isCameraOn, toggleCamera } = useCamera();
```

## Enable microphone

Microphone works similar to camera. In order to enable it, you have to call `toggleMicrophone` method.

```ts
const { isMicrophoneOn, toggleMicrophone } = useMicrophone();
```
