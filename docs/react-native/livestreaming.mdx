# Livestreaming

This section provides examples on how to quickly set up a livestreaming flow in React Native using Fishjam.  
You can learn more about [livestreaming in Fishjam](/livestreaming) in our documentation.

## How to start streaming?

First, you need to create a room of a special `livestream` type using our Server SDKs. If you are using sandbox, the [Room Manager](/room-manager#how-do-i-use-it) also allows you to create such room.
As the streaming is one-to-many, you can have only one streaming participant in that room.  
To start streaming, simply [join the room](/react-native/connecting) and [stream as you would normally do](/react-native/start-streaming).

:::warning
Livestreaming scenario allows only one video and one audio track to be sent at a time.  
You cannot stream the camera and share a screen at the same time.
:::

## How to receive the stream?

Fishjam SDK provides a [`useLivestream`](/api/mobile/functions/useLivestream) hook to receive the broadcasted stream.
In order to use it, you need to generate a viewer token using our Server SDKs (Room Manager also provides this functionality as an example).
The `useLivestream` hook will handle the process of receiving the stream and will forward it to `LivestreamView`.

:::info

This guide assumes you already finished either the [Quick Setup](/react-native/quick-setup) or [Installation](/react-native/installation) guide.

:::

You can also use Fishjam to livestream your content to users.

In order to do this you need to create two flows.

1. The first flow will be used to stream the content.
2. The second flow will be used to receive the livestream.

## Livestreaming Example

<ConfigurePermissions />

</details>

Here is an example of a simple component that immediately streams the front camera:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import {
  useCamera,
  useConnection,
  VideoPreviewView,
} from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

const ROOM_MANAGER_ID = "";

export default function Streamer() {
  const { prepareCamera } = useCamera();
  const { joinRoom, leaveRoom } = useConnection();

  useEffect(() => {
    const startStreaming = async () => {
      console.log("Getting room details...");
      const { url, peerToken } = await getRoomDetails(
        "TestRoom",
        "StreamerUserName",
      );

      console.log("Preparing camera...");
      await prepareCamera({ cameraEnabled: true });

      await joinRoom({ url, peerToken });
      console.log("Streaming...");
    };

    startStreaming();
    return () => {
      leaveRoom();
    };
  }, [prepareCamera, joinRoom, leaveRoom]);

  return (
    <VideoPreviewView
      style={{ width: "90%", aspectRatio: 1, alignSelf: "center" }}
    />
  );
}

async function getRoomDetails(roomName: string, peerName: string) {
  // This will work ONLY for the Sandbox App
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/${ROOM_MANAGER_ID}/room-manager/?roomName=${roomName}&peerName=${peerName}&roomType=livestream`,
  );
  return response.json();
}
```

## Receiving the stream

Here is an example of a component that just receives a livestream.
The `LivestreamView` component will render the video stream once you connect to Fishjam using the connect method from `useLivestream`.

```tsx
import { useCallback, useEffect } from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import {
  useLivestream,
  LivestreamView,
} from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

const YOUR_APP_ID = "";

export function Receiver() {
  const { connect, disconnect } = useLivestream();

  const handleConnect = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      console.log("Getting stream details...");
      const { token } = await getViewerToken("TestRoom");
      await connect(`https://fishjam.io/api/v1/live`, token);
      console.log("Receiving...");
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  }, [connect]);

  useEffect(() => {
    handleConnect();

    return () => {
      disconnect();
    };
  }, [handleConnect, disconnect]);

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
      <LivestreamView
        style={{ width: "90%", aspectRatio: 1, backgroundColor: "black" }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

async function getViewerToken(roomName: string) {
  // This will work ONLY for the Sandbox App
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/${YOUR_APP_ID}/room-manager/${roomName}/broadcast-viewer-token`,
  );
  return response.json();
}
```
