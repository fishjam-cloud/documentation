## Reading metadata

Peer metadata are available as `metadata` property for each peer. When you list peers with `usePeers` hook, you can also read
metadata associated with it. Note that `metadata.peer` property contains metadata set by client SDK (as in above examples).
And `metadata.server` data are set with server SDK as [described here](/production/server#metadata).
