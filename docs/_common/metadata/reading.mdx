## Reading metadata

Peer metadata are available as `metadata` property for each peer. When you list peers with `usePeers` hook, you can also read
metadata associated with it.
Note that `metadata.peer` property contains metadata set by client SDK (as in above examples).
The metadata set on the server side are available at `metadata.server`.
Learn more about server metadata [here](/production/server#metadata).
