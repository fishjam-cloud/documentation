Alongside with audio and video, it also possible to send additional metadata with each peer. Metadata is just
JSON that could contain additional information. Most common usage is to send user name associated with a track.
But it can be also used to send camera type, application information etc.

You can also set metadata on [the server side, when adding user to the room](/production/server#metadata). These metadata are defined while creating a peer on the server side and are persistent throughout its lifetime.  Server metadata allow attaching information that can't be overwritten, like information about real user name
or basic permission info.
