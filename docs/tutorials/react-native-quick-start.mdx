# React Native Quick Start

This tutorial will guide you through integrating Fishjam into your React Native application step by step.  
By the end, you'll have a working video streaming app and understand the core concepts.

## What you'll build

A simple React Native app that can join conference calls and stream audio/video between participants.

## What you'll learn

- How to install and configure Fishjam SDK
- How to join a room and start streaming
- How to display video and play audio from other participants
- How to check connection status

## Prerequisites

- React Native development environment set up
- Access to [Fishjam Dashboard](https://fishjam.io/app)

## Step 1: Install and configure

### Install the package

<InstallPackage />

### Configure app permissions

<ConfigurePermissions />

### Build native dependencies

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

### Get your Fishjam ID

1. Log in to [Fishjam Dashboard](https://fishjam.io/app)
2. Navigate to your Sandbox environment
3. Copy your Fishjam ID

### Set up Fishjam context

Wrap your app in the `FishjamProvider` component:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { FishjamProvider } from "@fishjam-cloud/mobile-client";

const App = () => null;

// ---cut---

// Check https://fishjam.io/app/ for your Fishjam ID
const FISHJAM_ID = "YOUR_FISHJAM_ID";

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <FishjamProvider fishjamId={FISHJAM_ID}>
      <App />
    </FishjamProvider>
  );
}
```

:::important
This won't work on the iOS Simulator, as the Simulator can't access the camera. Test on a real device.

For more detailed implementation follow the steps below.

## Step 2: Join a room and start streaming

Create a component that joins a room and starts streaming video:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "react-native";
import {
  useConnection,
  useSandbox,
  useInitializeDevices,
} from "@fishjam-cloud/mobile-client";

export function JoinRoomButton() {
  const { joinRoom } = useConnection();
  const { initializeDevices } = useInitializeDevices();
  const { getSandboxPeerToken } = useSandbox();

  const handleJoinRoom = async () => {
    const roomName = "testRoom";
    const peerName = "testUser";

    // In sandbox environment, you can get the peer token from our sandbox API
    // In production environment, you need to get it from your backend
    const peerToken = await getSandboxPeerToken(roomName, peerName);

    // Start camera by selecting the first available camera
    await initializeDevices({ enableAudio: false }); // or just initializeDevices(); if you want both camera and mic

    // Join the room
    await joinRoom({ peerToken });
  };

  return <Button title="Join Room" onPress={handleJoinRoom} />;
}
```

## Step 3: Check connection status

Monitor your connection status:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Text } from "react-native";
import { useConnection } from "@fishjam-cloud/mobile-client";

// ---cut---
export function ConnectionStatus() {
  const { peerStatus } = useConnection();
  return <Text>Status: {peerStatus}</Text>;
}
```

## Step 4: Display your video

Show your own video stream:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Text, View } from "react-native";
import { RTCView, useCamera } from "@fishjam-cloud/mobile-client";

//TODO: FCE-2487 remove it when MediaStream will be updated
interface MediaStreamWithURL extends MediaStream {
  toURL(): string;
}

export function StreamPreview() {
  const { cameraStream } = useCamera();
  const streamURL = cameraStream
    ? (cameraStream as MediaStreamWithURL).toURL()
    : null;

  return (
    <View>
      {streamURL ? (
        <RTCView
          streamURL={streamURL}
          style={{ height: 300, width: 300 }}
          objectFit="cover"
          mirror={true}
        />
      ) : (
        <Text>No camera stream</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Step 5: Display other participants

Show video from other peers in the room:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { View, Text } from "react-native";
import { usePeers, RTCView } from "@fishjam-cloud/mobile-client";

//TODO: FCE-2487 remove it when MediaStream will be updated
interface MediaStreamWithURL extends MediaStream {
  toURL(): string;
}

function VideoPlayer({ stream }: { stream: MediaStream | null | undefined }) {
  const streamURL = stream ? (stream as MediaStreamWithURL).toURL() : null;

  return (
    <View>
      {streamURL ? (
        <RTCView
          streamURL={streamURL}
          objectFit="cover"
          style={{ height: 300, width: 300 }}
        />
      ) : (
        <Text>No video</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
}

export function ParticipantsView() {
  const { remotePeers } = usePeers();

  return (
    <View>
      {remotePeers.map((peer) => (
        <View key={peer.id}>
          {peer.cameraTrack?.stream && (
            <VideoPlayer stream={peer.cameraTrack.stream} />
          )}
        </View>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}
```
