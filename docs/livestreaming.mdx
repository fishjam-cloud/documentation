# Live streaming

For live streaming purposes, we suggest using livestream rooms that are specifically optimized for the one-to-many scenario.

The main differences are:

- Livestream rooms are 20% cheaper than regular rooms
- Livestream rooms are optimized for one-to-many scenario and allow for hundreds of people to participate
- Compatible with WHEP standard
<!-- *  TODO: compatibility with WHIP -->

## How do I use it?

### Streamer

To create a livestream room, you must set the `roomType` field to `livestream` when creating a room using our [Server SDKs](/production/server). Then you have to create a peer that will be used to stream your content.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
  
    ```ts
    const createdRoom = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType: 'livestream' });

    const peer = await fishjamClient.createPeer(createdRoom.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

    ```python
    options = RoomOptions(room_type="livestream")
    created_room = fishjam_client.create_room(options)

    peer = fishjam_client.create_peer(created_room.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>
 </Tabs>

Now, you can connect the peer normally to the room as described in our [React Native](/react-native/connecting) and [React](/react/connecting) docs.

:::info
The livestream rooms support only one video and audio track; any additional tracks will be ignored and will not be available to the viewers.

### Viewers

To view the streamed content, you need to obtain a viewer token that can be generated using [Server SDKs](/production/server).

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
  
    ```ts
    // createdRoom ... previously created room
    const viewerToken = await fishjamClient.createBroadcastViewerToken(createdRoom.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

    ```python
    # created_room ... previously created room
    viewer_token = fishjam_client.create_livestream_viewer_token(created_room.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>
 </Tabs>

Now you can connect the viewer to the livestream as described in our [React Native] and [React] docs.

:::info
Viewers connect using [WHEP](https://blog.swmansion.com/introducing-react-native-whip-whep-ac9e5588d4da) standard, allowing the use of any player that supports the WHEP standard.
