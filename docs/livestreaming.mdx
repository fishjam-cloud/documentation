# Live streaming

For live streaming purposes we suggest using livestream rooms specifically optimized for this use case.

Main differences:
*  Livestream rooms are 20% cheaper than regular rooms
*  Livestream rooms allows for greater scalability
*  Compatible with WHEP standard 
<!-- *  TODO: compatibility with WHIP -->

## How Do I Use It?
### Streamer
To create a livestream room, you must set the `roomType` field to `broadcaster` when creating a room using our [Server SDKs](/production/server). Then you have to create one peer that will be used to stream your content.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
  
    ```ts
    const createdRoom = await fishjamClient.createRoom({ roomType: 'broadcaster' });

    const peer = await fishjamClient.createPeer(createdRoom.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

    ```python
    options = RoomOptions(room_type="broadcaster")
    created_room = fishjam_client.create_room(options)

    peer = fishjam_client.create_peer(created_room.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>
 </Tabs>

Now, you can connect peer normally to the room as described in our [React Native](/react-native/connecting) and [React](/react/connecting)  docs.

:::info
The livestream rooms support only one video and audio track; any additional tracks will be ignored and will not be available to the viewers.
:::

### Viewers
To view the streamed content you need to obtain viewer token that can be generated using [Server SDKs](/production/server).

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
  
    ```ts
    // createdRoom ... previously created room
    const viewerToken = await fishjamClient.createBroadcastViewerToken(createdRoom.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

    ```python
    # created_room ... previously created room
    viewer_token = fishjam_client.create_livestream_viewer_token(created_room.id)
    ```

  </TabItem>
 </Tabs>

Now you can connect viewer to the livestream as described in our [React Native] and [React] docs.

:::info
Viewers connect using [WHEP](https://blog.swmansion.com/introducing-react-native-whip-whep-ac9e5588d4da) standard, allowing the use of any player that supports the WHEP standard.
