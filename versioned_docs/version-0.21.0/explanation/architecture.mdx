# Fishjam Architecture

_Understanding how Fishjam works under the hood_

This document explains the technical architecture of Fishjam and how data flows through the system.

## High-level Architecture

Streaming with Fishjam is simple: you create a room, add peers to it, and start streaming. Below is a high-level overview of how Fishjam works.

## Components Overview

### 1. Your Backend Server

Your application's backend server is responsible for:

- Authenticating users
- Creating rooms using Fishjam Server SDKs
- Generating peer tokens for clients
- Managing room lifecycle and permissions

### 2. Fishjam Media Server

The Fishjam Media Server is the core infrastructure component that:

- Routes audio and video streams between participants
- Handles WebRTC negotiations and connections
- Manages different room types (conference, audio-only, livestream)
- Processes and transcodes media when needed
- Enforces security policies and token validation

### 3. Client Applications

Client applications (React Native, React) use Fishjam Client SDKs to:

- Connect to rooms using peer tokens
- Send and receive audio/video streams
- Handle device management (cameras, microphones)
- Manage connection state and reconnections

## Data Flow

### 1. Room Creation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FM as Fishjam Media Server
    participant BE as Your Backend
    participant Client as Client App

    Client->>BE: Request to join room
    BE->>FM: Create room (Server SDK)
    FM->>BE: Return room ID
    BE->>FM: Create peer (Server SDK)
    FM->>BE: Return peer token
    BE->>Client: Send peer token + Fishjam URL
```

### 2. Media Streaming Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C1 as Client 1
    participant FM as Fishjam Media Server
    participant C2 as Client 2

    C1->>FM: Connect with peer token
    C2->>FM: Connect with peer token
    C1->>FM: Send video/audio stream
    FM->>C2: Route stream to other peers
    C2->>FM: Send video/audio stream
    FM->>C1: Route stream to other peers
```
