## What is an Agent?

An agent is a piece of software that allows your backend server to participate in a Fishjam room, similar to how the Fishjam client SDKs allow your client-side application to participate in a Fishjam room.
They can be used to implement features such as real-time audio transcription, real-time content moderation, conversations with AI agents and more.

You can simply think of an agent as a peer running within your backend application.
