# Type Alias: VideoLayout

> **VideoLayout** = `"FILL"` \| `"FIT"`

Defined in: [packages/react-native-client/src/types.ts:6](https://github.com/fishjam-cloud/mobile-client-sdk/blob/13bc6085d5c0268377acde140fe9c29c39eaf73b/packages/react-native-client/src/types.ts#L6)

`FILL` or `FIT` - it works just like RN Image component. `FILL` fills the whole view
with video and it may cut some parts of the video. `FIT` scales the video so the whole
video is visible, but it may leave some empty space in the view.
