# What is Fishjam?

_Understanding the role and purpose of Fishjam_

Fishjam is a multimedia streaming toolkit that allows you to build real-time video and audio streaming applications.
It uses [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) under the hood to ensure sub-second (in most cases **less than 300ms**) latency.
We provide the infrastructure, media server, and client SDKs so you can focus on building your apps.

**No WebRTC knowledge is required!**

## The Problem Fishjam Solves

Building real-time video and audio applications is complex. Developers typically need to:

- Set up and manage WebRTC infrastructure
- Handle complex peer-to-peer networking
- Manage media servers and scaling
- Deal with different devices and codec compatibility
- Implement secure token-based authentication

Fishjam abstracts away this complexity, providing a simple API and managed infrastructure.

## What Fishjam Provides

Fishjam consists of several components that work together to provide a seamless multimedia streaming experience:

| Component             | Description                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Developer panel       | The place to access your credentials and manage your Fishjam usage.                                     |
| Fishjam Media Servers | Media servers route your multimedia traffic. We host and manage them for you.                           |
| Fishjam Client SDKs   | Toolkit used for multimedia integration on endpoint devices.                                            |
| Fishjam Server SDKs   | Toolkit for integrating your backend with Fishjam. We currently support Python and NodeJS.              |
| Sandbox API           | Simple backend for creating test rooms. You can test Fishjam without having to set up your own backend. |

## Use Cases

Fishjam is ideal for:

### Video Conferencing

Build videoconferencing applications with multiple participants in rooms, screen sharing, and audio/video.

### Livestreaming

Stream live content from one streamer to many viewers with low latency.
Perfect for live events or streaming platforms.

### Audio-only Applications

Create voice-only experiences like audio conferencing, podcasts, or voice chat applications.
