## Reading metadata

Peer metadata is available as the `metadata` property for each peer. Therefore, when you list your peers with the `usePeers` hook, you can read
the metadata associated with them.
Note that the `metadata.peer` property contains only the metadata set by the client SDK (as in the examples examples above).
The metadata set on the server side is available as `metadata.server`.
Learn more about server metadata [here](../../backend/server-setup#metadata).
